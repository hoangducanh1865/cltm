crude	ECUADOR QUAKE TO CUT OIL REVENUES 800 MLN DLRS   up to 300 people were feared dead and more   than 15,000 people left homeless by thursday's earthquake,   which will cost Ecuador close to 800 mln dlrs in lost petroleum   revenues, authorities said.       They estimated the cost of repairing a damaged oil pipeline   at 150 mln dlrs.       "the magnitude of the damages caused by the earthquake is   gigantic," president leon febres cordero said after inspecting   the damages in napo, the hardest-hit jungle province, 100 miles   from here.       The quake damaged 40 km of an oil pipeline, forcing this   opec nation to suspend crude exports for four months, president   febres cordero said in a statement issued today by the   presidential press office.       The country would lose an estimated 800 mln dlrs in crude   exports until the pipeline was repaired, the president said. It   would cost 150 mln dlrs to repair the pipelline which carries   oil from jungle oil fields over the andes to Balao, a pacific   ocean port.       Crude traditionally accounts for up to two-thirds of   ecuador's exports.       the quake triggered landslides, swelling the aguarico river   which burst it banks carrying away homes and huts in napo   province, health minister jorge brancho told reuters.       "we fear that up to 300 people died in napo though there is   no way of now knowing the exact figure because many people have   disappeared," he said.       Other estimates ranged as high as 500 dead.       So far 20 corpses have been recovered, bracho said.       Information Minister Marco Lara told reporters: "the number   of dead and injured is not known ... because we do not know how   many people lived in the homes hit by the landslides."       Bracho said at least 15,000 were left homeless in the   cayambe district.

Earlier today GenCorp said it will not ask shareholders to   approve an increase in the number of its outstanding shares,   the election of a staggered board of directors and the   elimination of cumulative voting.       However, the group said it will continue to try to block   GenCorp's poison-pill provision.

earn	BAYERNVEREIN EXPECTS UNCHANGED DIVIDEND FOR 1987   Bayerische Vereinsbank AG &lt;BVMG.F>   expects to pay an unchanged dividend of 13 marks on 1987   earnings but profits will only barely reach last year's record   levels, management board spokesman Maximilian Hackl said.       He told the annual news conference that possible credit   risks, especially those associated with foreign nations, had   largely been covered. Risk provisions in 1987 were therefore   unlikely to reach the same high level as in 1986.       Group bank net profit rose to 275.52 mln marks in 1986 from   222.73 mln the previous year and parent bank net profit   increased to 187.63 mln marks from 161.58 mln.       Hackl said that interest margins in the banking business   had declined to 2.71 pct last year from 2.78 pct the previous   year. But in the mortgage sector, the margins had increased   slightly and stood around 0.7 pct.       Parent bank commission surplus in the securities business   had risen almost 15 pct to 358 mln marks in 1986.       Expenses for personnel had increased 7.5 pct to 782 mln   marks and others costs had increased 9.4 pct to 272 mln marks.       The parent bank's 1986 partial operating profit, which   excludes earnings from trading on its own account, had climbed   two pct to 671 mln marks.       The parent bank's balance sheet total rose 5.3 pct to 81.5   billion marks at end-1986 compared with end-1985, Hackl said.       It was boosted by a three billion mark rise in mortgage   business and a 1.1 billion mark increase in banking business.       The mortgage sector's share in total parent bank business   volume rose to 46 pct from 45.       Hackl said that in January and February this year, the   bank's credit business had not livened up. But despite the   sharp downturn on German bourses, profits from trading on own   account had increased in the first two 1987 months compared   with the same year-ago period. He gave no detailed figures.

crude:ship	TURKEY LIFTS SURVEY SHIP ESCORT AS TENSION ABATES   Turkey pulled warships back from close   escort of its Sismik 1 survey ship as the threat of conflict   with Greece over oil rights in the Aegean Sea abated.       The semi-official Anatolian Agency said naval vessels ended   their close protection of the ship as it continued work in   Turkish waters but were following it at a distance.       Popular newspapers headlined what they saw as Turkish   resolve and international pressure forcing Greece to pull back   from planned exploration in disputed international waters.       "Intense United States and NATO efforts bore fruit: Greece   will stay in its national waters," said the daily Gunes. The   top-selling Hurriyet topped its front page with: "Our resolute   stand made Greece see reason."       But two newspapers, Cumhuriyet and Milliyet, noted in   identical headlines -- "Crisis Frozen" -- that the basic   disagreement over exploration rights remained unsolved.       The confrontation eased after the Turkish government said   it had been assured Athens would not begin prospecting in   disputed waters.

earn	BRUNSWICK &lt;BC> SEES HIGHER 1987 FIRST QUARTER   Brunswick Corp expects 1987 first   quarter sales to be up "dramatically" and profits to "do well,"   chairman and president Jack Reichert said after a securities   analysts meeting.       He declined to be more specific.       In the 1986 first quarter, Brunswick reported earnings of   23.8 mln dlrs or 57 cts a share on sales of 396.7 mln dlrs.       Reichart noted that results of its two newly-acquired boat   manufacturing companies will be included in the company's first   quarter report.       Brunswick expects its recreation centers to benefit from   increased attention to the sport of bowling resulting from   acceptance in the 1988 Summer Olympics of bowling as an   exhibition sport and as a medal sport in the 1991 Pan American   Games, he said.       He said field testing of a new bowling concept involving   electronic features is being readied for test marketing this   summer, and if successful, could "materially benefit"   operations.       Brunswick is currently test marketing in California a   health club facility adjoining a bowling center, he said.       Turning to its defense operations, Reichert said he expects   the division to receive significant contracts in the near   future. At 1986 year end, Brunswick's defense contract backlog   stood at 425 mln dlrs.       Frederick Florjancic, vice president-finance, told analysts   Brunswick was disappointed two credit rating services recently   downgraded the company's debt which stood at about 665.4 mln   dlrs at 1986 year end.       "We are confident we can service our debt and bring it down   in the very near term," based on strong cash flow from   Brunswick's expanded boat operations, Florjancic said.       Shareholders at the company's April 27 annual shareholders   meeting will be asked to approve an increase in the authorized   common shares outstanding to 200 mln from 100 mln shares, a   company spokesman said.

cotton:grain:rice:wheat	U.S. FARM POLICY DEBATE COULD HIT SENATE SOON   The Senate this week might take up   proposed legislation that could serve as a lightning rod to   expose broad initiatives to change U.S. farm policy.       The Senate could consider a House-passed bill that would   allow wheat and feedgrains farmers to receive at least 92 pct   of their income support payments if flooding last year   prevented, or will prevent, them from planting their 1987   crops, Senate staff members told Reuters.       Also pending is a bill extend the life of the National   Commission on Dairy Policy.       Sen. Rudy Boschwitz, R-Minn., intends to offer an amendment   to one of the bills that would suspend the minimum planting   requirement for all 1987 wheat, feedgrain, cotton and rice   producers, an aide said.       Under current law, producers must plant at least 50 pct of   their base acreage to be eligible for 92 pct of their   deficiency payments.       Most major U.S. farm groups have lobbied hard against   making any fundamental changes in the 1985 farm bill out of   fear a full-scale debate could expose agricultural problems to   budget-cutting pressures.       Representatives of these farm groups have said they also   fear efforts by Midwestern Democrats to force a floor vote on a   bill that would require large acreage set-asides in return for   sharply higher support prices.       However, Sen. Tom Harkin, D-Iowa, sponsor of the bill, told   Reuters he did not intend to offer his measure as a floor   amendment but to bring it through the committee.

trade	BALDRIGE PREDICTS END OF U.S.-JAPAN TRADE DISPUTE   The United States and Japan will   soon settle their trade dispute over semiconductors, U.S.   Commerce secretary Malcolm Baldrige said on television.       Baldrige, referring to the U.S.-Japan trade agreement on   semiconductors, said: "Their government wants to live up to it.   Their industries haven't been doing it, and I think we'll have   a good settlement to spare both sides."       "I think the Japanese understand full well that they haven't   lived up to this commitment," he said.       He added: "I do not think there will be a trade war at all."       On Friday, Washington announced plans to put as much as 300   mln dlrs in tariffs on Japanese electronic goods from April 17,   because of Tokyo's failure to observe the agreement.       The officials said the tariffs would be ended as soon as   Japan started adhering to the agreement. But they said there   was little chance Japan could react quickly enough to avert the   higher tariffs.       Baldrige said the Reagan administration hoped the strong   U.S. Action against Japan would convince Congress to tone down   protectionist trade legislation now being drafted.       He denied the action had been taken for that reason.

iron-steel:ship	REPORT EXPECTS SHARP DROP IN WORLD IRON IMPORTS   World seaborne iron ore imports will   fall sharply by the year 2000 with declining imports to the EC   and Japan only partially offset by increased demand from South   East Asia, a report by Ocean Shipping Consultants said.       The report predicts annual world seaborne iron ore imports   of 267.7 mln tonnes by 2000 versus 312.4 mln tonnes in 1985.       It estimates that total bulk shipping demand from the iron   ore sector will fall by almost 10 pct, or 200 billion tonne   miles, with shipping demand associated with the coking trade   down about 17 pct or 130 billion tonne miles.       The report sees EC imports falling to 91.7 mln tonnes in   2000 from 123.6 mln in 1985 with Japanese imports falling to 89   mln from 124.6 mln tonnes. Imports to South East Asia are seen   rising to 58.6 mln from 32.6 mln tonnes in 1985.       It predicts that EC steel production will fall to 109 mln   tonnes in 2000 from 135.7 mln in 1985 with Japanese production   falling to 92 mln from 105.3 mln.       South Korea and Taiwan are expected to double their output   to 40 mln tonnes with Chinese production increasing by 25 mln   tonnes to 80 mln, it added.

acq:crude	UNION PACIFIC &lt;UNP> TO SELL PART OF REFINERY   Union Pacific Corp said it will sign a   pact in Caracas on March 17 with Petroleos De Venezuela, PDVSA,   to sell the state owned company half of its Corpus Christi,   Texas refinery owned by its Union Pacific's Champlin Petroleum   Co subsidiary.       The sale will also include the related marketing and   distribution system for the refinery's products.       A spokesman for the company said that a statement may be   issued later today giving details of the transaction.       There was no immediate comment from PDVSA officials in New   York.       The Corpus Christi refinery has a capacity of about 160,000   barrels per day, the Union Pacific spokesman said, and is a   largely upgraded facility but he would place no value on the   transaction.       The additional acquisition of refinery and distribution   assets by PDVSA has been expected as Venezuela has been moving   aggressively to enhance its role in the oil industry from   producer to excpanding its presence in the downstream sector.       Purchase of part of Champlin's operations also fits a   profile which PDVSA officials have said previously they looked   for in any acquisition.       One PDVSA official said the company was looking for   independent oil companies with good refinery and distribution   network and a strong regional presence.       The potential purchase of the interest in Champlin followed   its earlier acquisition of a part interest in Southland Corp's   &lt;SLC> Citgo Petroleum Corp subsidiary.       In that agreement signed September 15, 1986, PDVSA paid   Southland 290 mln dlrs for half of Citgo's stock.       The potetnital acquisition of half Champlin's Corpus   Christi plant will also give Venezuela an additional outlet for   its crude oil production while giving the refiner an assured   source of supply, trade sources said.       In the earlier deal with Southland, PDVSA agredd to to   supply Citgo with at least 130,000 bpd of crude oil and other   feedstocks.

corn:grain	FRANCE TO REQUEST PERMANENT MAIZE REBATES   French maize producers will ask the EC   Commission to grant permanent maize export rebates following   the recent EC/U.S. Accord guaranteeing the U.S. An annual   export quota of two mln tonnes of maize for Spain over four   years, the French maize producers association, AGPM, said.       The Commission has already decided to accord rebates for   the export of 500,000 tonnes of French maize, of which rebates   for around 100,000 tonnes have been granted.       The request will be made when export certificates have been   granted for all the 500,000 tonnes, the AGPM said.       The association said that the request would cover exports   to all destinations, adding that the Soviet Union, which has   important maize needs, is currently excluded from the list of   destination countries for the 500,000 tonnes of French maize.       The U.S. Agriculture Department has forecast Soviet maize   imports for the 1986/87 campaign at 4.90 mln tonnes against   10.40 mln in 1985/86.

interest	INDIAN RATE CUTS TO SPARK INDUSTRY, AGRICULTURE   The Indian Finance Ministry's   announcement in Parliament yesterday, changing the nation's   interest rate structure, will benefit industry and agriculture   by providing loans at lower interest, bankers and brokers said.       The changes, effective today, included reducing commercial   bank lending rates that have ranged between 15 pct and 17.5 pct   by one percentage point.       New rates, which affect both Indian and foreign banks, also   include a one percentage point gain, to an annual 10 pct, on   deposits of two years or more but less than five.       Bank deposits of five years or more carrying 11 pct   interest have been abolished.       Bankers said the interest rate modifications reflect the   government's concern to reduce the costs of borrowing and help   improve world competitiveness of Indian goods.       There is likely to be a shift to short-term bank deposits   by long-term depositors, bankers predicted. This will create   the flexibility to draw and re-invest funds in either equity   shares or short-term bank deposits, they said.       A merchant banker also said reduced manufacturing costs due   to lower lending rates are likely to boost the share market.       Tata Steel, a trend setter on the Bombay Stock Exchange,   opened today higher at 1,040 rupees against yesterday's closing   of 1,012.50 rupees.       A stockbroker said investors may be less enthusiastic now   to buy convertible and non-convertible debentures because the   Finance Ministry has reduced the annual interest rate to 12.5   pct and 14 pct respectively from 13.5 and 15 pct respectively.       "But overall debenture prospects remain bright because the   rates of interest on them will still be higher than what banks   pay for deposits of similar maturity," a merchant banker said.

sugar	BRITISH SUGAR SOWINGS OFF TO SLOW START   Drilling of this year's British sugar   beet crop got off to a slow start due to poor weather   conditions with only around one pct sown so far, a spokesman   for British Sugar Plc said.       This compares with two pct at the same stage last year,   three pct in 1985 and 38 to 39 pct in 1984.       There is little cause for concern with better weather   forecast and the capacity available to drill the contracted   area of around 200,000 hectares in about 10 days. Seed beds   look good and farmers are advised to wait for soil temperatures   to rise, the spokesman said.       "If the crop can be drilled by the third week in April we   will be delighted," he said. Last year a large proportion of the   crop was not drilled until May but it still turned out to be   the equal second largest on record.
acq	CHARTER FEDERAL &lt;CHFD>, JEFFERSON TO MERGE   Charter Federal Savings and Loan   Association of Bristol, Va., said it has agreed to acquire   Jefferson Savings and Loan Association of Warrenton, Va.       Under terms of the transaction, which would result in a 1.3   billion dlr thrift institution, stockholders of Jefferson will   get 30.50 dlrs per share, half in cash and half in shares of   Charter.       The resulting association will operate under the name of   Charter and will be based in Bristol.       The transaction is valued at about 16.3 mln dlrs, a   Jefferson spokesman said.       Charter said the merger is subject to approval of the   Federal Home Loan Bank Board.       Jefferson reported a 1.5 mln dlrs loss and assets of 360   mln dlrs for the year ended September 30, 1986.       For the year ended June 30, Charter reported net income of   7.9 mln dlrs.

rubber	RUBBER TALKS CHAIRMAN CITES SLIGHT PROGRESS   There has been slight progress towards   reaching a rubber pact, the chairman of a United Nations   conference on a new International Natural Rubber Agreeement,   INRA, Manaspas Xuto of Thailand, said.       "There has been some slight progress but it is not the end   of the road yet," he said.       The conference, which began Monday, is seen as the last   effort to adopt an accord to replace the current one which   expires in October. Some 40 producing and consuming countries   are taking part in the two-week meeting.       Xuto said if the key outstanding issues are not resolved by   tomorrow he would hold weekend meetings.       At the beginning of the conference, the fourth such meeting   in nearly two years, Xuto said it was imperative to settle   those issues this week so that technical drafting work can be   done next week.       Conference sources said it is highly unlikely that   producers will accept a pact that will provide for any possible   downward adjustment of the floor price, as proposed by   consumers under certain circumstances.       The sources said this means that any possible adjustment   would centre on the reference price, and the "may buy" (or "may   sell") and "must buy" (or "must sell") levels without changing the   "lower indicative price" (or floor price) of 150   Malaysian/Singapore cents a kilo in the present pact.       The present five-day average of the indicator price is   around 192 Malaysian/Singapore cents.       Consumers are seeking an adjustment of the reference price,   set in the current accord at 201.66 Malaysian/Singapore cents a   kilo, and of the "lower indicative price" if the buffer stock,   currently 360,000 tonnes, rises to 450,000 tonnes.       Consumers want price reviews at 12-month intervals instead   of the 18 at present, and the price revision mechanism to   respond automatically to market trends.       At present, if the market price has been above or below the   reference price for six months, the reference price is revised   by five pct or by an amount decided by the International   Natural Rubber Organisation council.       Consumers say that, in these circumstances, the adjustment   be automatic at five pct or more.       Producers have resisted reducing the role of the council in   the price adjustment procedure and have expressed concern that   changes proposed by consumers would weaken the present pact.

Union said a 1.50 dlrs cut brings its posted price for the   U.S. benchmark grade, West Texas Intermediate, to 16 dlrs.   Louisiana Sweet also was lowered 1.50 dlrs to 16.35 dlrs, the   company said.       No changes were made in Union's posted prices for West   Coast grades of crude oil, the company said.

sugar	SOVIET SUGAR IMPORTS HIGHER IN OCT/NOV   Soviet sugar imports in October and   November were significantly higher than in the same period of   the year before, according to figures received by the   International Sugar Organization.       Imports in October totalled 23,803 tonnes, compared with   4,685 tonnes in the same month of 1985, while November imports   were up to 136,029 tonnes from 46,541.       For the first 11 months of 1986, Soviet imports totalled   5.12 mln tonnes, against 4.30 mln in the same period of 1985.       The October 1986 import figure consisted entirely of whites   from Cuba, while the November total was made up of 84,037   tonnes Cuban whites and 51,992 tonnes whites from Thailand. Of   the imports in the January/November period, those from Cuba   were up to 3.81 mln tonnes from 3.65 mln and from Thailand to   292,808 tonnes from 22,800.       Soviet exports also increased in 1986. The January/November   export total of 289,232 compares with 165,859 tonnes in the   first 11 months of 1985. Exports in October 1986 were 20,064,   down from 38,853 a year earlier, while November exports were up   from 32,796 to 50,855 tonnes.

trade	S. KOREAN TRADE SURPLUS WITH U.S. SEEN FALLING   South Korea's record 7.1 billion dlrs   trade surplus with the U.S. is bound to diminish as the   country switches purchases from Japan in favor of U.S.   companies, Trade Minister Woong-Bae Rha said.        He rejected suggestions the Korean Won is undervalued, and   denied any plans for a "drastic and sudden" revaluation.       Rha is heading a trade mission to 37 U.S. cities. Last year   South Korea ran a 4.3 billion dlr trade surplus, including a   record 7.1 billion surplus with the U.S. and a 5.5 billion dlr   deficit with Japan.       Rha told Reuters in an interview the current trade mission   is looking for 2.0 billion dlrs in purchases from U.S.   companies, about a quarter of which represents "transferred   purchases from Japanese sources."       Rha said the items being sought by the current mission are   "mainly chemicals, machinery and parts."       He said South Korea is the fourth largest importer of U.S.   agricultural products. The current mission is not involved in   that area but there are plans to buy "substantial amounts of   cotton" from the U.S.       He noted his country "is clearly not as open as the American   market. Nor is it reasonable to expect that it should be,"   considering South Korea has a 40 billion dlr foreign debt and   spends six pct of its gross national product on defense.

interest	H.K. BANKS TO RAISE PRIME RATES SOON, DEALERS SAY   Banks in Hong Kong are likely to raise   prime rates by half a percentage point to 6-1/2 pct following a   one-quarter point prime rate increase by two major U.S. Banks   yesterday, dealers said.       They told Reuters local banks may decide on the increase at   this weekend's routine meeting of the Hong Kong Association of   Banks.       G.C. Goh, chief dealer of the Standard Chartered Bank, said   prime rate increases by Citibank and Chase Manhattan Bank to   7-3/4 pct from 7-1/2 may prompt Hong Kong banks to follow suit.       Goh said local banks want to restore the prime to 6-1/2   pct, the level at beginning of 1987.       The banks raised the prime to the current six pct from five   pct on February 28 after cutting it 1-1/2 points from 6-1/2 on   January 15 in response to upside pressure on the Hong Kong   dollar, he said.       The medium and longer term interbank rates firmed today,   with three months ending at 5-1/16 to 4-7/8 pct against   yesterday's five to 4-13/16 close. The overnight rate, however,   fell to 3-1/2 to three pct from 4-1/2 to four because of   increased liquidity for a local stock issue.

rubber	NEW RUBBER PACT APPEARS IN THE BALANCE   Negotiations on a new International   Natural Rubber Agreement, INRA, are approaching the   make-or-break point and prospects for a future pact appear to   be in the balance, delegates said.       Manaspas Xuto of Thailand, chairman of the INRA   renegotiation conference, is holding consultations with a small   group of producers and consumers to try to resolve major   outstanding issues. When the talks began on Monday Xuto said   those issues should be settled by the end of the first week to   allow time to draft an agreement during the second week.       The talks are due to last until March 20.       Xuto said, "There is nothing concrete yet, but the   atmosphere is good." The discussions are expected to continue   late into the night, and Xuto said he may hold weekend   meetings.       Delegates said negotiations now focus on the degree to   which price adjustments should be automatic.       At present, if the market price has been above or below the   reference price (set at 201.66 Malaysian/Singapore cents a kilo   in the current agreement) for six months, the reference price   is revised by five pct or by an amount decided by the   International Natural Rubber Organisation council.       Consumers are asking that, in these circumstances, the   adjustment be automatic at five pct or more.       Producers want the council to have the last word and have   resisted reducing its role in the price adjustment procedure.       Delegates said there seems to be optimism about settling   another issue -- that of the floor price.       It now appears that consumers may consider dropping their   insistence of a downward adjustment of the floor price, called   the "lower indicative price," under certain circumstances.       This means that any possible compromise would centre on the   reference price, and the "may buy" (or "may sell") and "must buy" or   "must sell" levels, without changing the "lower indicative price"   -- which is set at 150 Malaysian/Singapore cents in the current   pact.       Delegates said that in exchange for consumer flexibility on   the floor price question, producers may consider agreeing to   another consumer proposal for more frequent price reviews -- at   12 month intervals instead of 18 at present.

copper:grain:wheat	WESTERN CANADA HURT BY INTERNATIONAL FORCES   Western Canada's resource-based economy   is being hurt by international market forces and there is   little Ottawa can do about it, Finance Minister Michael Wilson   said.       "If you can tell me how we can get the international energy   price up and how we can get the price for copper up and how we   can get the price for wheat up, then we will listen," Wilson   told the House of Comnons Finance Committee.       Although under pressure from oil companies and wheat   farmers for help in battling depressed commodity prices, Wilson   said it has to be recognized the area was a "prisoner of market   forces outside the boundaries of this country."       Wilson, appearing before the committee to discuss the   government's spending estimates released earlier this week,   said the government is doing what it can in the region, citing   more than 3.5 billion dlrs in aid for western agriculture.       "Those resources are a reflection of very real concerns on   our part in dealing with a very difficult problem," Wilson said   in response to questions about management of the economy from   opposition party members.       He said the long term answer for depressed regions of the   country was reaching a free trade pact with the United States,   which he claimed would improve the outlook for Western Canada.

The U.S., the world's largest copper consumer and second   biggest producer after Chile, has proposed setting up a body to   improve statistics and market transparency of the copper   economy, and provide a forum for discussion.       The new body would not aim at negotiating measures to   stabilise depressed world prices.       This week's meeting, which began yesterday, is due to end   Friday.
crude:fuel:nat-gas	NATURAL GAS SEEN RECAPTURING SOME MARKET SHARE   Higher crude oil prices will raise   demand for natural gas, helping it to reclaim market share lost   to heavy oil when prices plunged in 1986, analysts said.       The analysts said that these efforts will be most   successful in the industrial sectors of the economy with large   and growing energy requirements.       "Natural gas stands a good chance to recapture the share of   oil supplied to electric utilities that it lost to the residual   fuel industry last year," Michael Smolinski, an energy   economist with Data Resources Inc, told Reuters.       An estimated 200,000 barrels per day of residual fuel went   into the utilities market at the expense of natural gas last   year when world oil prices plunged, Smolinski said.        Assuming oil prices hold above 15 dlrs a barrel, national   average gas prices delivered to the utilities at a projected   2.10 to 2.25 dlrs per mln Btu would be very competitive,   Michael German, vice president of economic analysis at American   Gas Association said.       The average delivered prices at the end of January were   2.10 dlrs per mln Btu, compared with 3.26 dlrs a year ago.       "We expect natural gas to regain 250 to 400 billion cubic   feet (of demand) in the overall energy market in the second and   third quarter (1987)," he said.       In addition to price competitiveness, availability will be   an important factor persuading energy users to switch to gas,   Frank Spadine, senior energy economist with Bankers Trust Corp.   in New York noted.       Spadine said the mild winter in many parts of the North   American continent has led to a build up of gas inventories and   less would be necessary to replenish underground storage this   spring freeing gas for spot sales.       These forecasts develop a strong counterpoint to the fears   that natural gas suplies would be tight and prices   significantly higher given a sharp decline in drilling last   year.       AGA's German contended that despite the drilling decline,   much of U.S. proved reserves could be brought to production   quickly through developments such as the infill drilling which   permits more wells to be drilled in proved reserve basins.       Citing recent EIA statistics, German said, the gas surplus   was likely to contract from three trillion cubic feet in 1986   to two trillion cubic feet in 1987, but the surplus would not   go away until 1990.       Smolinski of Data Resources agreed that the surplus would   persist until 1990. While gas supplies may tighten in certain   consuming areas, notably in California and in the Northeast   U.S., an overall shortfall appeared remote.

Formal documents will be sent to shareholders as soon as   possible, it said in a brief statement.       BTR Nylex, which manufactures rubber and plastic products,   first bid for BWA in late January.       As previously reported, Borg-Warner Corp, which owns 65 pct   of BWA's ordinary shares and 100 pct of the preferences,   advised a month ago that it would not accept the offer.       This meant BTR Nylex's 50.1 pct acceptance condition could   not be met, BWA said in a statement reporting its parent's   decision.

money-fx:reserves	PERU BEGINS FOREIGN EXCHANGE RATIONING   Peru will put into effect Monday a foreign   exchange rationing system for imports designed to stop a slide   in the country's international reserves, a government decree in   the Official Gazette said.       Under the system, importers will be required to present a   bill from the foreign seller of goods and apply for a license   for foreign exchange. The central bank will have 10 days to   decide whether to issue the required foreign exchange.       Net international reserves now total about 800 mln dlrs   compared to 1.54 billion dlrs a year ago.       The system will be effective until the end of 1988.       A ceiling for foreign exchange availability will be set by   a council with members from the central bank, the economy   ministry and the planning and foreign trade institutes. The   central bank will issue licenses to procure foreign exchange in   accordance with guidelines set by the council.       Peru's reserves fell sharply due to a drop in the trade   surplus to about five mln dlrs in 1986 from 1.1 billion in   1985, according to preliminary central bank estimates.      Total exports dropped to 2.50 billion dlrs last year against   2.97 billion in 1985.      Imports last year rose sharply as gross domestic product   grew by about 8.5 pct, the highest economic growth level   registered in 12 years.

cocoa	ICCO COUNCIL AGREES COCOA BUFFER STOCK RULES   The International Cocoa Organization   (ICCO) Council reached agreement on rules to govern its buffer   stock, the device it uses to keep cocoa off the market to   stabilise prices, ICCO delegates said.       The date on which the new rules will take effect has not   been decided but delegates said they expected them to come into   force early next week, after which the buffer stock manager can   begin buying or selling cocoa.       Since prices are below the "may-buy" level of 1,655 Special   Drawing Rights a tonne set in the cocoa pact, the manager is   likely to buy cocoa sooon to support the market, they said.       Delegates and traders said they expected the manager,   Juergen Plambeck, to intervene in the market within three weeks   of the pact coming into force.       The rules permit him to buy and sell cocoa from origins or   the second hand market on an offer system, not by means of a   posted price as in the previous cocoa accord.       The cocoa will be priced according to a fixed set of   differentials, ranging from 137 stg for most expensive Ghana   cocoa to zero for Malaysian cocoa.       Purchases from non-members, such as Malaysia, will be   limited to 15 pct of the total stock and those on any one day   should be limited to 40 pct each in nearby, intermediate and   forward positions.       The council meeting, which is expected to conclude two   weeks of sessions involving various working groups and the   council itself, was continuing, the delegates said.       The current cocoa agreement came into force on January 20   during a previous meeting of the council which was unable to   agree on the rules to implement buffer stock operations.

The company said it will make the proposal to shareowners   at its annual mmeting May 6 in Dothan, Ala., near the company's   Great Southern Paper division operations.       In conjunction with the stock split proposal, the   shareowners will be asked to approve an increase in the   authorized common stock from 60 mln to 150 mln shares, the   company said.       The company said it will propose an increase in its   dividend rate if the split is approved effective with the June   payment.       The company said the present rate on GNN common is 43 cts   per share. The company said it would recommend a quarterly rate   of 23 cts a share on the split stock. This would be equal to a   dividend of 46 cts a share on the present common, seven pct   higher than the current rate.       The company said it had increased the dividend by 13 pct   last December. Great Northern Nekoosa's last common stock   split, a three-for-two, was in December 1983, it said.       As of Dec 31, 1986, there were 26,661,770 shares of GNN   common stock outstanding, according to the company.

gnp:trade	GERMAN RESEARCH INSTITUTE LOWERS GROWTH FORECAST   The DIW economic research institute   said West German economic growth in 1987 is unlikely to reach   the 1.5 pct rate it had forecast earlier this year.       The institute, whose forecasts are more pessimistic than   those of the other four leading German institutes, said the   economy had passed its peak in the summer of 1986, and its   prospects had dimmed significantly since the autumn.       The DIW repeated earlier predictions that gross national   product (GNP) in the first quarter of 1987 would contract in   real, seasonally adjusted terms against the weak final quarter   of last year.        The DIW said that even if the economy recovers in the   remaining three quarters, it was unlikely that demand and   production would rise strongly enough to bring GNP growth up to   1.5 pct.       Other institutes and economists have recently revised their   forecasts for German 1987 growth to around two pct.       In a report DIW disputed arguments by other economists that   the economy was showing mixed development, with domestic demand   healthy but foreign demand weak.       DIW said the crucial split was between weak demand for   capital goods, and strong demand for buildings and consumer   goods, not between foreign and domestic demand.       It noted that domestic demand for capital goods had been   hit in recent months by the weakness of exports, which had   caused West German firms to scale back investment plans.       Service industries, unlike manufacturing industry, were   continuing to do well because they relied on consumer demand,   it said.       In a separate report the HWWA economic research institute   in Hamburg said West Germany's real trade surplus would fall   markedly this year.       However, the nominal trade surplus would show little change   from 1986's record 112.2 billion marks because of a further   improvement in the terms of trade on average in 1987 compared   with 1986, it said.

INSEE, which from January changed its base year to 1980   from 1970, originally had December output down 2.2 pct on   November, using the old base year.

tin	TIN COUNCIL WINDING-UP VERDICT APPEALED   Amalgamated Metal Trading, AMT, today   lodged an appeal against the ruling which prevented its   petition to wind up the International Tin Council, ITC.       The verdict was given by Mr Justice Millett on January 22,   when AMT led an effort by ITC creditors to recover sums claimed   by banks and London Metal Exchange brokers as a result of the   collapse of the ITC's buffer stock operations in October 1985.   AMT had until March 26 to lodge its appeal.       The grounds for the appeal are that the judge erred on   three points when giving his verdict, Michael Arnold, head of   the broker creditors group Tinco Realisations, told Reuters.       The judge ruled that the U.K. Court had no jurisdiction to   wind up the Tin Council, that the ITC was not an association   within the meaning of the Companies Act, and that the   winding-up petition was not a proceeding in respect of an   arbitration award. AMT will contest all three points.       The U.K. Companies Act allows the possibility of the   winding-up of what it defines as an association, and AMT will   argue that the Tin Council falls within this definition, Arnold   said.       The ITC has immunity except for the enforcement of an   arbitration award, and thus it is important for AMT that the   court accepts that the winding-up petition represents a move to   enforce an arbitration ruling.       The court originally decided that the winding-up petition   went wider than the enforcement of such a debt, an AMT   spokesman said.       The appeal is unlikely to be heard for several months, but   a case brought by fellow ITC creditor Maclaine Watson is to be   heard on April 28. This is a move by the metal broker to have a   receiver appointed over the ITC's assets.       Since similar arguments will be used in this case, it is   possible that any appeal in the Maclaine Watson case could be   consolidated with AMT's appeal, Arnold said.       Other ITC creditors have brought direct actions against the   Council's member states and an application by the governments   to strike out the first of these, brought by J.H. Rayner   (Mincing Lane) Ltd, is to be heard on May 11.       Shearson Lehman Brothers action against the LME's tin   "ring-out" in March 1986 is also scheduled to be heard in the   near future. The hearing date has now been put back slightly to   June 8.

Dealers said the market was surprised by the Chancellor's   disclosure of sterling target rates, around 2.90 marks and 1.60   dlrs, and nervous over the implications for domestic interest   rates, further reducing the propects for a near term cut in   U.K. Bank base rates. The key three months interbank sterling   rate gained 1/16 point at 10 9-7/8 pct.

He declined to be identified but said PdVSA has the   capacity to refine about 650,000 bpd of crude oil from refining   centers   in Venezuela, Sweden, West Germany, Belgium, and the United   States. The company recently purchased a 50 pct stake in the   Corpus Christi, Texas refinery of Champlin Petroleum Co, a   subsidiary of Union Pacific Corp &lt;UNP>.       Earlier it bought a similar stake in the Lake Charles, La   refinery owned by Citgo Petroleum Corp, a unit of Southland   Corp &lt;SLC>.        According to the official, Venezuela is searching   worldwide for the additional refining capacity but he did not   mention where the company was looking.        Refineries abroad, he said, guarantee a refining outlet for   Venezuelan crude oil while ensuring stability of supply to   refiners.       He said Venezuela currently  produces about 1.4 mln bpd of   crude oil, which is in line with its 1.495 bpd OPEC ceiling.
crude	VENEZUELA TO LEND ECUADOR 50,000 BPD OF CRUDE   Venezuela will lend Ecuador 50,000   barrels per day of crude oil over the next few months to help   it meet its export commitments, Energy and Mines Minister   Arturo Hernandez Grisanti said today.       He said that under the terms of this loan, agreed during a   visit here this week by Ecuador's Deputy Energy Minister   Fernando Santos Alvite, Ecuador will begin repaying the loan in   August.       Hernandez Grisanti said the loan will go part way to   offsetting the loss of Ecuador's 140,000 in exports caused by   earthquake damage to 25 miles of pipeline last week.       Ecuador was forced to suspend exports after the pipeline   connecting its jungle oil fields with the pacific port of Balao   was put out of action.       Venezuela has an output quota of 1.495 bpd, while Ecuador's   is 210,000 bpd. Santos Alvite said Ecuador will ask OPEC to   allow it to produce 100,000 bpd above its quota when the   pipeline is repaired to offset present production losses.       Hernandez Grisanti said also a first 300,000 barrels   shipment of Venezuelan crude oil will leave for Ecuador this   weekend to help meet domestic consumption needs.       The oil, part of a five mln additional crude oil loan by   Venezuela, will be processed at Guayaquil refineries.       "If we had not supplied oil to Ecuador the life of this   country would have ground to a halt," he said.

In an interview, he said that could result in about a 4.5   pct decline in annual earnings per share.       Pinola said First Interstate, like other banks, has not yet   decided to put the loans, which Brazil stopped paying interest   on last month, on non-accrual status.       "None of us really wants to injure negotiations that might   be going on," he said.       First Interstate reported to the Securities and Exchange   Commission last week that it has about 339 mln dlrs in   medium-to long-term loans to Brazil.       It said on December 31, 1986 its nonperformind Brazilian   outstanding debt totaled about 4.1 mln dlrs.       First Interstate also has about 168 mln dlrs in short-term   loans or trade lines to Brazil.       Pinola said he believes the solution to the Brazilian debt   crisis will be more political than economic, which he said he   finds, "very disquieting and discomforting."
acq	TWA &lt;TWA> SUES USAIR &lt;U> OVER POISON PILL   Trans World Airlines Inc said it filed   suit in Delaware Chancery Court against USAir Group Inc and its   board of directors seeking to invalidate its "poison pill"   anti-takeover plan.       TWA vice president and general counsel Mark Buckstein said   TWA also sought a declaratory judgement from the court that its   52 dlr per share takeover offer for USAir would in no way   interfer with USAir's possible buyout of Peidmont Aviation Inc   &lt;PIE>.       Buckstein said TWA asked the court to enjoin the   enforcement of USAir's shareholder rights plan, or "poison   pill." Such provisions, which typically allow for the issue of   securities to shareholders in the event of a hostile takeover   bid, are aimed at deterring takeovers by making them more   expensive.       USAir earlier today rejected TWA's offer, saying TWA's bid   was an attempt to interfer with its buyout of Piedmont.       USAir also had said its counsel would investigate the   matter. Tonight, a spokesman for USAir said the airline had no   comment on TWA's lawsuit.       USAir did respond, however, to a TWA request to the   Department of Transportation for permission to buy up to 51 pct   of USAir stock and place the stock in a voting trust pending   approval of a takeover.       USAir said the request was "hastily pasted together in   order to take advantage of a regulatory anamoly that would   allow TWA to accomplish in a regulated environment actions that   would be impermissable in the non-regulated economy at large."       USAir called on the transportation department to reject   TWA's request.

gold:platinum:strategic-metal	BLACK MINERS SUPPORT S. AFRICAN MINES TAKEOVER   Thousands of black   mineworkers roared support for a union proposal to seize   control of South Africa's gold, uranium, platinum and coal   mines if the owners refuse to improve conditions for migrant   black workers.       About 15,000 miners attended a rally here to endorse moves   proposed by last week's annual meeting of the 200,000 strong   National Union of Mineworkers (NUM).       They also supported a proposal for a national strike at the   end of this month if the owners refused to begin negotiations.       Migrant workers from surrounding countries make up more   than half of the labour force in the mines.       It was not stated how the union would "seize control."       The miners' leaders also demanded an end to the system of   single sex hostels for migrant workers, to be replaced by   housing schemes so that workers could live with their families.       The crowd, one of the largest to attend a meeting since   South Africa declared a state of emergency last June, also   shouted approval of a proposal to work closely with   anti-apartheid movements such as the United Democratic Front   (UDF) which claims two mln members. They also shouted their   support for a demand that jailed black nationalist leader   Nelson Mandela be released.

trade	U.S. TREASURY'S BAKER OPPOSES TAX INCREASE   U.S. Treasury Secretary James Baker   said that he opposes a Federal tax increase to help reduce the   budget deficit and favors spending cuts instead.       "I don't think it's (a tax increase) is a very good idea   and I'm quite confident that President Reagan doesn't think   it's a very good idea," Baker said in an interview on Cable   News Network's "Moneyline" television program.       He said U.S. taxpayers are taxed at a rate of 19 pct of GNP   which is traditionally where it has been, but the Federal   Government is spending at a rate of 24 pct of GNP. Baker said   spending cuts are clearly the best way to cut budget deficits.       Baker said he opposed a stock transactions tax proposed by   House Speaker Jim Wright, D-Tex, or other special taxes.       "The stock transfer tax would be a particularly unfortunate   approach to take," the Treasury Secretary said. He said the   United States has some of the most efficient capital markets in   the world and new taxes would impair efficiency.       On the international front, Baker said banks must do more   lending to developing countries. He was questioned about this   after the Standard and Poor's Corp downgrading today of the   debt of six major money center bank holding companies, largely   because of their heavy developing nation loan exposure.       Baker said that developing countries must adopt free market   economic policies such as in the United States. He said capital   flows will be required to support the needed reforms in the   economic systems of those countries.       The money must come either through equity or debt and Baker   said that developing nations' "investment regimes do not   support enough equity investment, so you've got to have some   debt there."       Commenting on the U.S. trade deficit, Baker said "I think   you're going to see a 15 to 20 billion dlr reduction this   year."

gold:silver	BELGIAN ECU COIN ISSUE PRICED, SALE DATE SET   A limited Belgian issue of silver Ecu   coins with a face value of five Ecus will go on sale from March   23 at a price of 500 Belgian francs each, a Finance Ministry   spokesman said.       Gold Ecu coins with a face value of 50 Ecus will be sold   from the same day. The spokesman told Reuters the price for   these would be fixed just before they go on sale but was likely   to be between 8,500 and 9,000 francs.       At least two mln silver coins and several hundreds of   thousands of the gold coins will be minted, he said. They will   be sold both in Belgium and abroad.       The coins will be the first ever denominated in the Ecu,   the "basket" comprised of the 12-nation European Community's   currencies except the Spanish peseta and the Portuguese escudo.       The issue is being made to mark the 30th anniversary of the   EC's founding Treaty of Rome this month. Finance Minister Mark   Eyskens, who currently presides over the EC's council of   economic and finance ministers, has called the issue a   political act of symbolic value which aimed to make the   Community's goal of monetary integration more concrete.       The coins will be legal tender in Belgium but most demand   is expected to come from coin collectors.
bop:interest:money-fx:trade	U.K. TRADE FIGURES BUOY HOPES OF INTEREST RATE CUT   The release of U.K. February trade data   showing that the current account surplus was a provisional 376   mln stg, up from a 73 mln surplus in January, has boosted hopes   of an early cut in interest rates, analysts said.       Market forecasts had been for a worse outcome, with   expectations of a deficit in visible trade averaging about 750   mln stg, against the official figure of 224 mln stg, sharply   narrower than January's 527 mln deficit.       "The figures are unreservedly good," Chase Manhattan   Securities economist Andrew Wroblewski said.       Sterling rebounded on the trade figures, reversing a weaker   morning trend, to stand at 72.1 pct of its trade weighted index   against a basket of currencies at midday, unchanged from   yesterday's close but 0.3 points above the 1100 GMT level.       The market had feared that a deteriorating non-oil trade   pattern would undermine international support for sterling,   which has been the motor behind the recent fall in U.K.   Interest rates. Money market sources said the market had begun   to doubt that a widely expected drop in bank base lending rates   to 9.5 pct from the present 10.0 pct was really on the cards.       But sentiment now looks to have turned about again.       There now looks to be no danger that the Chancellor of the   Exchequer Nigel Lawson's forecast of a 1987 current account   deficit of 2.5 billion stg will be exceeded, said Wroblewski.       Seasonally adjusted figures showed that imports rose in   February to 7.16 billion stg from 6.73 billion in January.       Exports rose to a record 6.93 billion from 6.20 billion.       However, Chris Tinker, U.K. Analyst at brokers Phillips and   Drew said that the faster rise in exports than imports would   prove partly aberrational in coming months. He forecast the   Chancellor's Budget tax cuts would increase consumer expediture   on imported goods.       However, Ian Harwood, economist at Warburg Securities, said   his firm was sharply revising its 1987 current account deficit   forecast in the light of the latest data, cutting one billion   stg off the expected full year total to about 1.75 billion stg.       He said news of strong growth in exports of non-oil goods   confirmed recent bullish surveys among members of the   Confederation of British Industry.       The growth in imports appears to be flattening, even if   January's bad weather had curbed consumer spending on overseas   goods and import-intensive stock building among manufactureres,   Harwood said.       U.K. Government bonds, or gilts, surged by more than 1/2   point on the better-than-expected news, as earlier worries   about the figures evaporated.       Sterling peaked at a high of 1.6075 dlrs, before settling   to a steady 1.6050 dlrs about 1300 GMT, nearly a cent higher   than the European low of 1.5960.       However, analysts noted that the turnabout in market   sentiment still looks highly vulnerable to political news.       Morning weakness in sterling and the gilt market was   largely attributed to a newspaper opinion poll showing that the   Conservative government's support was slipping.       The Marplan poll, published in "Today," showed Conservative   support had fallen to 36 pct, from 38 pct last month, while the   Alliance of Liberals and Social Democrats had rallied to 31   pct, from 21 pct, to run neck and neck with the Labour Party,   whose own support fell from 38 pct.       The poll was taken after the Budget, which was greeted   enthusiastically by financial markets but seems to have left   the voters indifferent, political observers said.       Another regular poll is due tomorrow, and eonomists warn   that today's improved sentiment could be dented if support for   Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher slips again.       This upsetting of the markets' political perceptions, which   are all but discounting a Conservative victory in the upcoming   general election, made them more sensitive to the trade data,   Harwood said. "The news did come as a very, very substantial   relief," he said.       However, on the interest rate front, economists caution   that Lawson might be wary of leaving sterling vulnerable by   encouraging another base rate fall. They noted Lawson had   already got an inflation-reducing cut in mortgage rates in   response to lower base rates, so domestic political reasons for   lower rates have been curtailed.
grain:wheat	PAKISTAN NOT SEEN AS MAJOR WHEAT EXPORTER   Pakistan is not emerging as a major   wheat exporter as world market prospects are not good enough,   Sartaj Aziz, Special Assistant on Food and Agriculture to the   Pakistani Prime Minister, said in an interview.       No exports are planned for the next 12 months or so and   plans last year to sell one mln tonnes to Iran came to nothing   because they could not agree a price, he said.       Aziz forecast that Pakistan may have exportable surpluses   of one mln tonnes or a half mln tonnes over the next few   harvests in years when the weather is favourable.       The government does not wish to increase output much above   this because of low world prices, and the land would be better   used for other crops.       Aziz said the Pakistani government does not want area sown   to wheat to increase from the current seven mln hectares. Some   10 pct of that area which gives low yields could be switched to   more profitable crops such as oilseeds.       The aim is to concentrate on raising yields from the   current 1.8 to 1.9 tonnes per ha to at least 2.5 tonnes per ha   over the next five to seven years, he said.       Aziz said the current 1986/87 crop, harvesting of which is   just beginning, is expected to yield around a record 14.5 mln   tonnes. This compares with a target of 14.7 mln and last year's   yield of 14.0 mln.       He said rains some six weeks ago helped the crop but more   recent rains reduced prospects slightly.       The long-term wheat production target is for some 17 mln   tonnes by mid-1993, taking into account Pakistan's annual   population growth rate of more than three pct. Current   consumption is some 12.5 mln tonnes.       The current wheat reserve is 2.5 mln tonnes, Aziz said.   This compares with a minimum reserve commitment of one mln   tonnes, which Pakistan will maintain at all costs, and a   "strategic reserve" target of two mln tonnes.       Despite the fact that stocks are a half-mln tonnes over   target, the surplus will not be exported at present, he said.       The government wants to keep an extra "safety margin" until   it sees what effect the abolition of a 44-year-old wheat   rationing system will have on domestic consumption. New exports   will be considered only in about a year's time when the 1987/88   crop can be gauged as well, he said.       The new domestic policy, introduced on March 15, is for the   government to supply unlimited quantities of wheat at two   rupees per kilo. With other costs this means a price in   Pakistani markets of between 2.30 and 2.50 rupees per kilo.       Under the old system, introduced during World War Two and   due to be phased out by April 15, some 50 mln ration cards were   issued enabling poor people to buy wheat cheaply.       Aziz said following the introduction of a government   support price in the 1970s the system become so corrupted that   only 20 to 25 pct of subsidised wheat was actually reaching the   consumer, the rest being diverted illicitly to the mills.       The ration system had also not had the stabilising effect   on the internal wheat market that was intended, Aziz said.       Prices have already begun to fall with the introduction of   the new system. The wheat price in Karachi, the most expensive   Pakistani city, had dropped from 3.11 rupees per kilo on March   1 to 2.85 rupees on March 30.       Aziz said he does not expect the change in system to have a   major effect on total consumption, but it may encourage better   use of side-products such as bran.
acq	WALL STREET STOCKS/POLAROID &lt;PRD>   Rumors that New York investor Asher   Edelman has acquired a stake in Polaroid Corp and optimism   about tomorrow's status hearing on the patent infringement suit   pending with Eastman Kodak Co &lt;EK> sent Polaroid's stock   higher, traders said.       Polaroid rose 1-1/8 to 74-1/2.       "Speculation that Edelman was going to take a stake in   Polaroid was kicking around a few months ago, and resurfaced   today," one trader said.       Edelman had no comment on the rumors.       A spokesman for Polaroid said the company had not been   contacted by Edelman and no filing had been made with the   Securities and Exchange Commission about a stake in the   company.       "There is some hope among investors that there will some   progress in the status hearing tomorrow on the patent   infringement suit with Kodak," analyst Michael Ellmann of   Wertheim and Co said.       Traders said it is conceivable that a trial date could be   set or some progress made on an out-of-court settlement.       The suit, filed by Polaroid in April 1976, charges that   Kodak infringed upon Polaroid's instant camera patent. In   October 1985, the court barred Kodak from selling cameras or   film that infringe upon the patent, the Polaroid spokesman   said.       Ellmann said he feels it is highly unlikely that any   progress will be made in tomorrow's hearing.       Ellmann said the stock may have also gotten a boost today   from some optimism concerning new products the company is   currently working on.       "Polaroid's announcement that a particularly senior company   executive had been chosen to work on a major unidentified new   product spurred some speculation about their products," he   said. "I am speculating that the new product could be an   electronic still camera," referring to a camera that records   its images on magnetic disks as opposed to conventional film.

veg-oil	U.S. REAFFIRMS OPPOSITION TO EC OILS TAX PLAN   A meeting among government agencies   today reaffirmed the strong opposition of the United States to   a proposed new tax on vegetable oils and fats in the European   Community, U.S. trade officials said.       Representatives of the major government agencies agreed at   a trade policy review group meeting, which includes officials   of the deputy secretary rank, to continue diplomatic pressure   on EC member states.       "We (all agencies) are together on this," said one U.S.   trade official.       One source said the U.S. would continue to make clear to   member states and to the EC commission that if Brussels   proceeds with the vegetable oils tax "there will be a great   cost."       U.S. officials said no formal list of European products on   which the U.S. might retaliate, has yet been drawn up.       "I don't think we're at that point yet," said one trade   official, adding that the EC has only begun deliberations on   its farm price package.       Suzanne Early, assistant trade representative, told Reuters   the interagency meeting was to discuss U.S. strategy on the   vegetable oils issue. Asked about retaliation, she said   "sometimes its better not to be specific."       U.S. trade representative Clayton Yeutter Monday warned   another major transatlantic trade row will develop if the EC   proceeds with the vegetable oils tax.
copper	NORANDA SETS TEMPORARY MINE SHUTDOWN   &lt;Noranda Inc> said   production will remain shut down at its fire-damaged copper   mine here until it can completely examine the mine.       The fire, which started Wednesday and burned itself out   late yesterday, killed one miner and trapped 56 others   underground for about 24 hours. The 56 were eventually brought   safely out of the mine.       Company spokesman Dale Coffin said the investigation could   take from a few days to several weeks, but would not be more   specific.       Noranda said that, when it resumes production, it plans to   operate the mine at about one-third of the normal 72,000 metric   tons annual finished capacity.       The fire weakened part of the mine's support structure,   Coffin said.       Noranda said if it decides to keep the mine open, it would   take four or five months before it could resume full   production.

Currently a farmer, to be eligible for corn program   benefits, must restrict his plantings of other program crops to   the acreage base for that crop.       Several members of Congress from Iowa have complained that   farmers who inadvertantly failed to certify that they had grown   oats for their own use in the past now are being asked to halt   oats production or lose corn program benefits.       USDA likely will allow historic oats farmers to plant oats   but not extend the exemption to all farmers, Lyng's aide said.

crude:earn:nat-gas	BRITOIL SEES LOWER U.K. EXPLORATION EXPENDITURE   Britoil Plc's &lt;BTOL.L> exploration   expenditure for the U.K. In 1987 was likely to be only about a   third of the level in 1986, though overseas expenditure would   remain approximately the same, Chief executive David Walker   said.       He told reporters following the release of the company's   1986 figures that project expenditure would also remain at 1986   levels.       U.K. Project expenditure in 1986 rose to 208 mln stg from   184 mln while exploration expenditure dropped to 87 mln from   156 mln. Overseas exploration fell to 28 mln from 58 mln in   1985.       Earlier, Britoil posted a drop in pretax profit for 1986 to   134 mln stg from 759 mln in 1985, before an extraordinary   charge of 50 mln stg on the company's U.S. Assets. The results   were slightly better than analysts forecast and the share   firmed to 231p from 222p at last night's close. Chairman Sir   Philip Shelbourne said the collapse in the oil price in 1986   had made the period extremely difficult but the company had   come through remarkably well.       Provided the recovery in oil prices was maintained, the   conditions would be right for a substantially improved   performance this year.       He added that the firmness of oil prices in March, when   they were normally weaker, made him "a bit encouraged" about the   prospects for future levels.       Walker added that Britoil would feel confident if the price   stayed within a band of 15 dlrs to 20 dlrs a barrel.       Britoil had received some 100 responses to its announcement   of a desire to sell the assets and was asking for bids by the   latter part of April.       End-year reserves rose to 603 mln barrels of oil compared   with 503 mln previously. However, Walker noted that this   included a revised definition of reserves.       If 1985 figures were restated along the same lines, the   reserve figure would show a drop from 720 mln barrels   previously.       Gas reserves also eased to 3,568 billion cubic feet from a   restated 3,660 billion.

crude	UK CROSS FIELD PRT RELIEF FAVOURS SMALLER FIELDS   The "cross field allowance" relief on   Petroleum Revenue Tax (PRT) announced by U.K. Chancellor of the   Exchequer Nigel Lawson this week will favour smaller non-PRT   paying fields, according to stockbrokers Wood Mackenzie and Co.       The cross field allowance offsets up to 10 pct of   qualifying spending on a new oil field against PRT liability of   other fields. It is restricted to new offshore developments   outside the southern basin and yet to gain Annex B approval.       A report by the stockbrokers said that on a new field not   paying PRT due to its small size, the relief would directly   benefit in PRT saving on an existing field.       "The cross field allowance will mainly benefit participators   in those fields which have no PRT liability," the report said,   adding that the timing of development of such fields may be   advanced.       The government would in effect be subsidising these   developments at 7.5 pct of capital expenditure before   corporation tax, the report said.       On fields likely to pay PRT in the future, the benefit is   of timing. Although liabilities on other existing fields will   be reduced immediately, liabilities on larger new fields will   rise in the future due to the loss of offsets, it said.       In a study on probable fields, the report said that when   the rates of return are examined, the rise for a PRT-paying   field such as Miller, the largest undeveloped oil field in the   U.K. North Sea, is from 18.7 to 19 pct, while the rise for a   small non-PRT paying field such as Kittiwake is 15.9 to 17.9   pct.       The report added that in fields which pay PRT, there will   be a cost in being able to have this early relief. Not only   will these costs be unavailable for offset against the field's   future profits, but uplift of some 35 pct on these costs will   be lost.       Thus, a saving of PRT of 100 when field development starts   will have to be matched by a rise in PRT of 135 at a later   time.

Wright told reporters the plan by Sen. Lloyd Bentsen, a   fellow Texas Democrat, was positive and useful. Oil imports   peaked in 1977 at 47 pct, were short of 36 pct last year and   this year are up over 40 pct, Bentsen said.        The Bentsen proposal, supported by 24 other Senators, would   would require the president to issue annual three-year oil   import forecasts. In any year they threatened to top 50 pct, he   would be ordered to propose quotas or other solution.

bop:trade	GERMAN CURRENT ACCOUNT SURPLUS WIDENS IN FEBRUARY   West Germany's current account   surplus widened to a provisional 6.6 billion marks in February   from a slightly downwards revised 4.8 billion in January, a   spokeswoman for the Federal Statistics Office said.       The trade surplus in February widened to a provisional 10.4   billion marks from 7.2 billion in January, she added.       The Statistics Office had originally put the January   current account surplus at 4.9 billion marks.       The February trade surplus was well up on the 6.84 billion   mark surplus posted in the same month of 1986. But the current   account surplus was down slightly from the 6.85 billion surplus   recorded in February 1986.       A Statistics Office statement said the widening of the   February current account surplus compared with January was due   to seasonal factors. Neither the trade nor current account   figures are seasonally adjusted.       February imports, measured in terms of value, totalled   32.11 billion marks, a decline of 10 pct against February 1986   but a rise of 5.5 pct against January.       Exports in February, also in value terms, totalled 42.56   billion marks, 0.5 pct less than in February 1986 but up 13 pct   compared with January.       The Statistics Office said it was not yet able to calculate   the real change in exports and imports in February. But for   comparison purposes it noted that in January the average value   of imports had fallen 15 pct year-on-year while the average   value of exports had declined by only 4.4 pct.       Within the current account, the services account had 300   mln marks deficit, supplementary trade items a 200 mln mark   surplus while transfer payments posted a 3.7 billion mark   deficit.       Taking the first two months of 1987 together, imports in   value terms fell 14 pct to 62.6 billion marks compared with a   year earlier. The value of exports totalled 80.2 billion marks,   a decline of 7.4 pct against the same months of 1986.       The resulting trade surplus of 17.6 billion marks for   January/February compares with a cumulative surplus of 14.1   billion marks in the year-ago period.       The cumulative current account surplus for January and   February 1987 totalled 11.3 billion marks against 11.4 billion   marks a year earlier, the Statistics Office said.       Bank economists said the rise in the February trade surplus   reflected an improvement in the terms of trade as well as   seasonal factors. The Federal Statistics Office said earlier   this week that February import prices fell 0.7 pct against   January while export prices were unchanged.       "The rise in the nominal figures masks a lower export trend   that is not expected to change for several months at least,"   said an economist. He said the nominal trade surplus for 1987   as a whole is likely to fall only slightly from the record   112.2 billion marks in 1986 but other economists said the   surplus could fall to around 80 billion marks.       An economist at the Bank fuer Gemeinwirtschaft (BfG) in   Frankfurt said a two-month comparison of trade figures gave a   more accurate picture of West Germany's trade position.       He noted the 17.6 billion mark surplus for January and   February together was lower than the 21.6 billion mark surplus   posted in November and December.       "The trend is clearly lower," he said.       This economist, who declined to be named, said the February   rise was also partly explained by special factors in January,   when there had been a number of public holidays as well as   extremely cold weather, both of which hindered trade.

The acquisition requires two-thirds approval by Husky   shareholders other than &lt;Nova, An Alberta Corp>, which owns a   57 pct interest in Husky.       If approved by shareholders, the amalgamation will take   effect April 30, Husky said.       Following completion, Oil Term Holdings Ltd, a new company   controlled by Nova, will hold a 43 pct stake in Husky.   Hutchison and Hongkong will indirectly hold 43 pct, Victor T.K.   Li will own nine pct and &lt;Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce>   will have a five pct interest.       Husky said a special committee of five outside directors   recommended the board approve the transaction after determining   that the deal was in the best interests of Husky and fair to   shareholders.       Husky previously announced shareholders will have the   option to receive 11.80 Canadian dlrs cash for each common, or   6.726 dlrs cash and one common share of Oil Term Investment   Ltd, which will be controlled by Nova through Oil Term Holdings   and own an insterest in Husky.

lei	U.S. LEADING INDEX ROSE 0.7 PCT IN FEBRUARY   The U.S. index of leading indicators   rose a seasonally adjusted 0.7 pct in February after a revised   0.5 pct January fall, the Commerce Department said.       The department previously said the index fell 1.0 pct in   January.       The February increase left the index at 187.1 over its 1967   base of 100, and was led by a rise in stock prices.       A total of four of nine indicators available for February   contributed to the increase in the index.       Besides stock prices, they were manufacturers' new orders   for consumer goods and materials, average work week and   building permits.       Five of nine indicators were negative. They were change in   sensitive materials prices, money supply, vendor performance,   average weekly initial claims for state unemployment insurance,   and contracts and orders for plant and equipment.       The main factor in the January revision was contracts and   orders for plant and equipment, the department said.       December also was revised to a 2.4 pct rise from an earlier   2.3 pct rise due to a change in outstanding credit.       The index of coincident indicators, which measures the   current economy, rose 0.9 pct in February after a decline of   1.3 pct in January and a rise of 0.9 pct in December.       The index of lagging indicators, which measures past   economic activity, decreased 0.3 pct in February after   increasing 1.7 pct in January and falling by 0.5 pct in   December.       The department said it has suspended net business formation   from the leading indicators index because it has deteriorated   as a measure of change in the business population.
ship	IRAN SAID TO TEST FIRE SILKWORM MISSILE IN HORMUZ   Iran has test-fired its newly acquired   Silkworm anti-shipping missile in the Strait of Hormuz and has   set up at least two land-based launching sites in the area, a   British naval source in the Gulf said.       The source, who declined to be identified, said Iran had   fired the Chinese-made missile at a hulk off its southern Gulf   naval port of Bandar Abbas and scored a hit.       "These missiles pack a fairly big punch," he told Reuters.   "There is no doubt they could be used to target (shipping)   across the Strait of Hormuz."       Tension in the Gulf has risen since U.S. Officials last   week broke the news that Iran had acquired the Silkworm   missiles.       The U.S. Has said it will not allow Iran to use the   missiles to choke off oil shipments and has offered its   warships to escort Kuwaiti tankers past the missile batteries.       But Tehran denied last Sunday it intended to threaten Gulf   shipping and warned the U.S. Any interference in the region   would meet a strong response.       The British naval source said the Silkworms were in place   at at least two sites around the Strait of Hormuz, but would   not give the exact location.

The report reviewing the country's economy in the first   three months of this year said year-on-year gnp was   provisionally estimated to have grown by about 12 pct in the   period, against a 10.5 pct growth in the same 1986 period.       Board officials said the gnp rise in the January-March   period is due largely to increased exports, which totalled 9.34   billion dlrs against 6.9 billion a year earlier.

corn:cotton:grain:meal-feed:oilseed:soy-meal:soy-oil:soybean:veg-oil	USDA COMMENTS ON EXPORT SALES    Corn sales gained 2,494,900 tonnes in   the week ended February 26, the highest weekly total since   August 1984 and two and three-quarter times the prior week's   level, the U.S. Agriculture Department said.       In comments on its Export Sales Report, the department said   sales of 1.0 mln tonnes to the USSR -- previously reported   under the daily reporting system -- were the first sales for   delivery to the USSR under the fourth year of the U.S.-USSR   Grains Supply Agreement, which began October 1.       Japan added 689,700 tonnes to previous purchases and sales   to unknown destinations rose by 429,800 tonnes.       Wheat sales of 362,400 tonnes for the current season and   151,000 for the 1987/88 season were down by more than half from   the previous week's combined sales, it said.       Egypt, Japan and Iraq were the major wheat buyers for   delivery in the current year, while sales to China decreased by   30,000 tonnes for the current season, but increased by 90,000   tonnes for the 1987/88 season, which begins June 1.       Net sales of soybeans totalling 274,200 tonnes equaled the   preceding week, but were nearly a third below the four week   average. Major increases were for Belgium, South Korea, Mexico   and Italy, it said.       Soybean cake and meal sales of 103,700 tonnes were 2-3/4   times the previous week's marketing year low, but six pct less   than the four week average.       Major increases for West Germany, Belgium, Spain, Italy and   Australia were partially offset by declines to unknown   destinations.       Soybean oil sales of 5,400 tonnes were the result of   increases for Venezuela and reductions of 500 tonnes for   unknown destinations.       Combined sales activity in cotton of 75,200 running bales   -- 44,700 bales for the current year and 30,500 bales for the   1987/88  bales -- were 56 pct below the prior week's good   showing, the department said.       Major purchasers for the current season were South Korea,   Japan, Taiwan and Thailand, while South Korea and Indonesia   were the major buyers for the 1987/88 season, which begins   August 1.

"He (Weinberger) opposes it. It is not in the best interests   of the country to have more of the micro-electronics business   leaving the United States," one of the Pentagon officials, who   asked not to be identified, told Reuters.       Commerce Department officials told Reuters yesterday that   Baldrige opposed the planned sale and that the White House   Economic Policy Council will take up the matter within weeks.       Commerce and defense officials said Baldrige and Weinberger   feared the U.S. military is already leaning too heavily on   foreign electronic support.       But the Defense Department also said today that Weinberger   and Baldrige differed on the proposed sale of U.S. computer   equipment to Iran.       The Commerce Department advised the Pentagon recently that   defense objections to two proposed sales -- to an Iranian power   company and the Islamic Republic of Iran News Agency -- were   not valid and the sales of small and medium computers would go   through unless more evidence was presented.
interest:money-fx	BANK OF FRANCE CUTS INTERVENTION RATE   The Bank of France said it cut its money   market intervention rate to 7-3/4 pct from eight pct when it   injected money against first category paper.       The bank also cut its seven-day repossession rate to 8-1/2   pct from 8-3/4 pct.       The intervention rate has stood at eight pct since it was   raised from 7-1/4 pct on January 2 as the French franc came   under pressure ahead of the EMS realignment on January 11.       The bank said the purchase, effective tomorrow, is for five   pct of private paper and fixed rate Treasury bills maturing   between March 25 and June 25 and of other Treasury bills   maturing between March 25, 1987 and March 25, 1989.       The rate cut had been expected since the bank announced a   money market intervention tender earlier today.       Money market dealers said conditions seemed right for a   quarter percentage point cut, reflecting an easing in the call   money rate last week, and the French franc's steadiness on   foreign exchange markets since the February 22 currency   stabilisation accord here by the Group of Five and Canada.
sugar	INDONESIAN SUGAR OUTPUT SEEN SHORT OF TARGET   Indonesia's raw sugar output is likely   to be 1.8 mln tonnes in calendar 1987, unchanged from 1986 and   below the government's 1987 forecast of 2.5 mln, the U.S.   Embassy said in its agricultural outlook for 1987.       Indonesia bought 162,500 tonnes of raw sugar on world   markets in late 1986, the report said.       The embassy estimated Indonesia's calendar 1986 raw sugar   production at 1.8 mln tonnes, against a government estimate of   1.99 mln.       It said that Indonesia's move into sugar self-sufficiency   in 1984 may have been short-lived.       The report said, "The government continues to promote   sugarcane production through its smallholder intensification   program and a relatively high guaranteed price to sugarcane   producers.       "However, there are considerable indications that farmers   are reluctant to plant cane because its economic return is not   as good as that of other crops."

crude	OPEC PRESIDENT SAYS OUTPUT WELL BELOW CEILING   Opec Conference President Rilwanu Lukman   said the group was producing well below the 15.8 mln bpd   ceiling it set in December, partly because liftings had been   delayed or postponed by customers unwilling to pay fixed Opec   prices.       Lukman, during a brief visit to London on his way home from   Jamaica, told Reuters in a telephone interview that in   February, Opec had underproduced partly because members were   strictly abiding by production quotas and partly because they   were resisting the temptation to sell at discounts to official   prices of around 18 dlrs a barrel.       "We are determined to stand firm by the (December) accord,"   he said. "I have spoken to every other Opec minister and they   are committed to making the accord work," he said.       Lukman gave no specific figures for February output. He   said the Opec secretariat in Vienna was finalizing these   figures.       Told of a Reuters survey published today which estimated   that Opec output so far this week was below 15 mln bpd, he   said; "That could well be correct."       Opec"s news agency Opecna today issued a statement saying   group output was "well below" its ceiling in February. But it   gave no figures.       But one source close to Opec indicated that February output   may have been between 15.3 and 15.5 mln bpd.       The Reuter survey estimated Opec February output at around   16 mln bpd.       Opec agreed in December to cut output by 7.25 pct to 15.8   mln bpd and to return to fixed prices starting February 1.       Lukman said Qatar, Nigeria, Saudi Arabia and Iran had all   produced in February below their Opec quotas. Iraq, which said   it would not honour its 1.466 mln bpd quota under the December   pact, had produced less than had been anticipated, he said.       Lukman said that some industry reports "may be correct" that   in February, Nigeria propuced 75-100,000 bpd below its 1.238   mln bpd quota, Saudi Arabia 500,000 bpd less than its 4.133 mln   allocation and Qatar 20 to 30 pct under its 285,000 bpd quota.       He said that sweet crudes such as those produced by his   country were coming under price pressure because they were   currently officially priced above sweet North Sea grades and   the United States" West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude.       However, he said Opec in December had anticipated that   demand would be slack at this time of year for seasonal reasons   and expected the market to firm in two to three weeks.       "We have to be patient for two or three weeks. The market is   now firming on actual fundamentals," he said, adding that he   expected it to go "up and up" even beyond official prices after   early April. This is when, traditionally, there is more demand   for gasoline-rich crudes such as Nigeria"s.       The Opec President said producers such as Kuwait, Venezuela   and Indonesia were having less problems with output than   producers like his own country because they exported oil   products.       Also, some of Venezuela"s heavy grades were outside the Opec   pricing system, he said.       Lukman said that if refiner-buyers, now refusing to lift   some Opec oil at official prices, instead used their own stocks   and ran them down to "dangerous levels," they would eventually   have to buy Opec oil.       "When they realise it is not a free-for-all (in the market)   they will realise they should buy now instead of paying more   later on," he said.       Lukman, asked about industry reports that Nigeria was being   pressured by equity producers for better terms, said it was   important to know that terms with them were negotiable,   flexible and under constant review, not only when the market   seemed weak.       He said that so far, no meeting of the seven-nation   ministerial differentials committee had been scheduled and that   such a meeting, now twice-postponed, was not a high priority   for Opec at the moment.       "At this time, we have to get our priorities right," he said.   "The most important thing now is ensuring that the accord is   working, not dealing with a differential of cents between   grades."       But if any Opec member raised concerns or objections over   the differential system, a meeting would be called, he said.
trade	EUROPEAN COMMUNITY TO SET UP OFFICE IN PEKING   China and the European Community (EC)   signed an agreement on the establishment of an EC office here.       Chinese vice-foreign minister Zhou Nan and the EC's   external relations commissioner, Willy De Clercq, signed the   accord. EC sources said the office was likely to open in the   second half of this year.       In 1986 the EC was China's third largest trading partner,   with Chinese imports from the EC worth 5.7 billion dlrs and   exports worth 2.6 billion dlrs.       De Clercq told the official China Daily that more joint   ventures should be set up in China as a way of reducing China's   trade deficit with the EC.       The EC's affairs in China are currently looked after by   whichever country holds the group's six-monthly rotating   presidency, now held by the Belgians until the Danes take over   in July.

lumber	OREGON LUMBER COMPANY TO SELL WOOD TO IRAQ   A Portland-based wood   products company has signed a 13 mln dlr contract with the   Iraqi government to supply finished softwood lumber to Iraq,   Edward Niedermeyer, president of Niedermeyer-Martin Co said   yesterday.       Niedermeyer told the House Foreign Affairs sub-committee on   International Economic Policy and Trade in Washington that the   sales agreement contains an option that could make lumber   exported worth more than 20 mln dlrs.       The delivery of about 8.0 mln dlrs worth of plywood, in   addition to lumber, hinges on whether the U.S. Department of   Agriculture will interpret plywood as an agricultural commodity   under the credit guarantee program, he said.       Niedermeyer said the government export credit guarantee   program (GSM-102) administered by the USDA was the key to   opening the Iraqi market which up to now had been captured by   Scandinavian lumber producers.       "This is the first time we have been able to sell wood   products in Iraq, he said. Without the USDA program it would   not have been possible. We hope this will lead to a long term   export market for U.S. lumber products."       He said the contract calls for supplying 21 mln board feet   to 30 mln board feet of softwood lumber for housing,   construction and furniture manufacturing. He estimated the   profit potential for his company on the sale at five to six   pct.       Niedermeyer spent two weeks in Baghdad negotiating the sale   late last month and early March. He is a member of the United   States-Iraq Business Forum, a non-profit group designed to   promote commerce with Iraq.       The forum members include Westinghouse and General   Electric, but Niedermeyer's company is the only wood products   firm on the membership roster.

trade	BRITISH AIDE CRITICIZES U.S.PROTECTIONISM   A senior British official said that   protectionist bills being considered by Congress could trigger   retaliation by the European Community (EEC) and threaten the   global trading system.       Paul Channon, secretary for trade and industry, said if   Congress passed legislation to curb textile imports, which   would hit EC shipments as well as shipments from major Asian   textile producers, "the community would have to retaliate."       His comments echoed those made yesterday by Belgian Trade   Minister Herman De Croo, who said if the bill passed, the   community would retaliate by imposing taxes on U.S. exports.       Channon made his remarks at a news conference after two   days of talks with Reagan Administration officials and members   of Congress.       De Croo was also in Washington for trade talks.       Channon said there was a greater protectionism sentiment in   Congress since his visit here last year as Congress and the   Administration tried to find ways to reduce the U.S. trade   deficit, which last year hit a record 169.8 billion dlrs.       Channon also called for greater EC-U.S. cooperation to   force Japan to open its markets to foreign goods.       Channon said Japan's trade surplus is causing everyone   problems - its surplus with the United States last year was   51.5 billion dlrs and with EC nations, 16.7 billion dlrs.       "The more united pressure there could be, the better," he   said.       Channon also called for increased U.S.-EC cooperation to   avoid trade disputes.       He said the two sides narrowly avoided a confrontation   earlier this year over lost grains sales when Spain and   Portugal joined the community and its liberal imports   regulations were tightened to conform to EC standards.       "But if both sides drew back from the brink that time," he   said, ""it does not mean that they would do so on another   occasion."       Channon added that "There is increasing reesentment in   Europe over the U.S. tactic of negotiating under the pressure   of unilaterally imposed deadlines."       He said other potential conflicts are already in sight -   alleged European government subsidies of Airbus aircraft and   taxes on fats and oils - and "the commuity and the United States   must therefore learn to manage their relations better."       He said another bill to let the United States retaliate   against a nation if that nation's market was not open to U.S.   goods would bypass the trade pact GATT (General Agreeeement on   Tariffs and Trade) as an arbiter of trade practices.       He said foreign trade law should be judged by GATT and not   by the United States, adding "if the (trade) law is to be   interpreted by the United States and not by the GATT, what is   to happen to the rest of us?"

The company said any decline would be due to expenses   related to the acquisitions in the middle of the current   quarter of seven licensees of Sealy Inc, as well as 82 pct of   the outstanding capital stock of Sealy.       Because of these acquisitions, it said, first quarter sales   will be substantially higher than last year's 67.1 mln dlrs.       Noting that it typically reports first quarter results in   late march, said the report is likely to be issued in early   April this year.       It said the delay is due to administrative considerations,   including conducting appraisals, in connection with the   acquisitions.
hog:livestock	HOG REPORT SHOWS MORE HOGS ON FARMS   The USDA quarterly hogs and pig report   yesterday showed more hogs on U.S. farms compared to last year   as profitability resulting from low grain prices encouraged   producers to step up production, analysts said.       Most analysts seemed to agree with Chicago Mercantile   Exchange floor traders that the report will be viewed as   bearish to pork futures and futures prices may open sharply   lower today. Some traders and analysts expect limit declines in   nearby contracts, with spillover selling likely in cattle.       University of Missouri agronomist Glen Grimes said,"The   report shows that hog producers have responded to a very   desirable feeding ratio that they enjoyed for the past 10   months."       Shearson Lehman analyst Chuck Levitt said hog futures   prices are above producers' break even points. Even if futures   fell the daily limit of 1.50 cents today, producers could still   lock in a profit, which increases the likelihood of heavy   selling pressure today.       "We have not had a period of profitability of this   magnitude since last summer," Levitt said. "In fact, hog   operations on many mixed livestock/grain enterprises have been   so profitable that it actually enabled some farmers to get back   on their feet and refinance their loans just based on the hog   operation alone."       Levitt said the weight breakdown in the report also was   negative, in that some lead time was anticipated before the   slaughter increased from the previous year.       We expected farmers to increase hog operations, but we   didn't expect this degree of expansion to show up in a 10-state   spring report, Levitt added.       High hog corn ratios (the number of bushels of corn that   could be bought for 100 lbs of hog) and the resulting increased   profits, encouraged farmers and confinement operations to   increase production starting late last year.       Analysts also noted that part of the increase in the hog   herd resulted from a revision of the December report and   without the revision, the March report might have been very   close to average expectations.       Robin Fuller of Agri Analysis said the USDA made a major   upward revision of 105,000 head in the size of the breeding   herd in the December 1 report. So the December report was more   bearish than initially indicated.       But Fuller, as well as other analysts, expected the report   to be less negative on deferred futures contracts. Distant   contracts are already at a sharp discount to cash because   traders anticipated high farrowing intentions, she noted.       Discounts in the October and December contracts take into   consideration a six to seven pct increase in March/May   farrowing intentions, which was borne out in the March 1   report, Fuller said.       Grimes said, "As far as the distant months are concerned,   if our first quarter pig crop is up only six pct and under 60   lb inventories actually up only five pct, it would take a   tremendous discount in price for each percent increase for us   to push down to the prices that the current futures show for   the July and August period."       Jerry Abbenhaus, analyst for AGE Clearing noted that   distant futures prices are already 15 to 20 dlrs lower than   they were last summer.       "If cash hogs at the 7-markets last year averaged 61 dlrs   during July, that doesn't mean hogs have to be 15 dlrs cheaper   this year because we have six pct more numbers," he said.
trade	JAPAN ALERTS GATT TO SOUTH KOREA IMPORT PLAN   Japan told the General Agreement on   Tariffs and Trade that South Korea's five-year import   diversification plan violated the spirit of the world trade   governing body, a Foreign Ministry spokesman said.       The notification came in Japan's answer to a recent GATT   questionnaire on unfair trade practices, the spokesman said.       In the five-year plan, which starts this year, South Korea   aims to reduce its dependency on Japan as a source of imported   goods and to increase imports from the U.S. And Europe.       Japan's move came after several unsuccessful bilateral   negotiations on the plan, the spokesman said.

The current account deficit narrowed to 750 mln dlrs in   February from 1.23 billion in January. It hit 13.82 billion   dlrs in 1985/86 to end-June.       The currency jumped to 0.6858/63 U.S. Dlrs and traded as   high as 0.6875 before retreating to around 0.6864/69.       "It's got 69 cents written all over it," one dealer said.       Foreign exchange dealers said some buyers had gone long on   the dollar expecting a lower figure and sold it down about 30   points to 0.6820 U.S. Dlrs before the release.       The 750 mln dlr deficit was at the lower end of forecasts   and analysts said the market would welcome any figure below one   billion dlrs for March.       Banque National de Paris &lt;BNPP.A> senior dealer Peter   Nicolls cautioned that in the long term the currency and   interest rates were too high for import substitution and export   industries.       Nicolls said he expected the dollar to go as high as 0.6875   and perhaps to 69 cents tomorrow.       &lt;Lloyds Bank NZA Ltd> chief economist Will Buttrose said   the 42 mln dlr trade surplus was encouraging as were imports at   2.77 billion dlrs, down from 2.99 billion in January.       But he warned that the outlook for rural and iron and coal   exports remained poor. "We should remember we are paying   something like seven to eight billion dollars simply to service   our foreign debt and that is not going to go away in the near   term," Buttrose said.       Buttrose said he expected a March deficit of around 900 mln   dlrs, and added "Any figure under a billion dollars will be   acceptable (to the markets)."       ANZ Banking Group Ltd &lt;ANZA.S> senior economist Ian Little   said the big question was whether the improvement in exports   could be sustained. February FOB exports rose to 2.82 billion   dlrs from a revised 2.74 billion in January.       Interest rates responded quickly to the deficit news, with   90-day bank bill yields falling to 16.42-16.45 pct from early   highs of 16.50 and yields yesterday as high as 16.65.       Longer term yields fell with 10-year bonds at 13.66/68 pct   from 13.74 before the release and highs of 13.87 yesterday.       The stock market was easier at midsession but brokers said   the current account data had little impact on trading.

It said in a statement the terms of the offer will be 13   new Rank Hovis shares for every five Avana ordinary shares,   valuing each Avana share at 829p.       Avana shareholders will be entitled to receive and retain   the net interim dividend of 5.25p per Avana share for the year   ending 28 March 1987.       Accepting Avana shareholders will also be entitled to   receive Ranks Hovis's forecast net interim dividend of 2.65p   for the financial year ending 5 September 1987.       Ranks Hovis said that full acceptance of the increased   offer would result in the issue of a maximum of 72.3 mln new   Ranks Hovis shares or about 20 pct of the enlarged issued   ordinary share capital of the company.       The latest offer will lapse on 17 April. Ordinary   shareholders in Avana who accept the increased offer will have   the opportunity to elect for cash for all or part of their   holdings on the basis of 800p cash for each Avana share.       Ranks Hovis said the cash required for the cash alternative   would be met by one of several methods.       For the first 10 mln Avana shares received opting for the   cash alternative, Ranks Hovis would make a cash payment from   its own resources.       For cash alternatives of more than 10 mln Avana shares,   Morgan Grenfell, as agent for participants, will make a   separate offer to purchase at 300p per share, net of expenses,   up to 46.3 mln Ranks Hovis new shares to which such   shareholders will be entitled under the increased offer. This   is equivalent to 780p per Avana ordinary.       In addition, Ranks Hovis will make a further cash payment   of 20p per Avana ordinary. Avana shares traded at 800p after   the announcement, 32p up from last night's close of 768p. REUTER

bop	DANISH CREDIT DOWNGRADING NOT DRAMATIC - MINISTER   Finance Minister Palle Simonsen said   today's downgrading of Denmark's credit rating by Standard and   Poor's Corp should not be over-dramatised.       Standard and Poor's said it had downgraded the Kingdom of   Denmark's long-term external debt to AA from AA-Plus, following   the country's loss of the top AAA rating in January 1983.       "This change is regrettable but there is no reason to   dramatise. This is a change of nuance. Standard and Poor's   defines the AA category as only slightly different from the top   AAA rating," Simonsen said in a statement.       "The direct effect of the lower rating on our borrowing   capability is unlikely to be very great. But if, against   expectation, we fail to reduce permanently the external account   deficit... This will inevitably affect borrowing terms and   capability," he added.       "Standard &amp; Poor's has noted that in 1986 there was a series   of austerity measures designed particularly to cut lending and   encourage saving. Tax reforms have also gone into effect.       "If and when it becomes necessary, the government will be   ready to take any necessary economic and political initiatives   as it has in the past," Simonsen said.      Standard and Poor's said weaker international   competitiveness in the face of rising labour costs would mean a   deteriorating current account balance and a rise in external   debt.       The external current account deficit rose to a record   preliminary 34.5 billion crowns in 1986 from 29.1 billion in   1985, bringing total foreign debt to 265 billion crowns,   according to government statistics.       Government economists forecast that the external current   account deficit will fall to 19 billion crowns this year.       Denmark's net foreign debt rose to 129 pct of total exports   in 1986 from 83 pct in 1983, S and P said.

crude	CHINA CLOSES SECOND ROUND OF OFFSHORE OIL BIDS   China has closed the second round of   bidding by foreign firms for offshore oil exploration rights,   the China Daily has reported.       It quoted a spokesman for the China National Offshore Oil   Corp (CNOOC) as saying China signed eight contracts with 15   foreign firms for blocks in the Pearl River mouth and south   Yellow Sea covering a total area of 44,913 sq km.       Second round bidding began at the end of 1984 and only one   well has so far produced results -- Lufeng 13-1-1, 250 km   south-east of Shenzhen, with an output of 6,770 barrels a day.   The well was drilled by a group of Japanese companies.       The spokesman added CNOOC was ready to enter into contracts   for offshore blocks before third round bidding began. He did   not say when this would be, but added the contracts would not   be bound by restrictions imposed during the second round.       China has signed 36 oil contracts and agreements with 37   companies from 10 countries since 1979, when offshore   exploration was open to foreigners. Eleven contracts were   terminated after no oil was discovered.       Foreign firms have invested 2.1 billion dlrs on offshore   China since 1979.
acq	DIXONS SAYS CITICORP TO WITHDRAW CYCLOPS OFFER   &lt;Dixons Group PLC> said it received a   letter on March 19 from Citicorp Capital Investors Ltd, part of   the Cyacq investor group making a rival bid for Cyclops Corp   &lt;CYL>, proposing to drop the group's offer if Dixons would sell   Cyclops industrial businesses to Citicorp.       "Cyacq's main equity investor appears ready to pull out and   deal directly with us for merely part of the company" said   Dixons. "It raises questions as to the strength of their   consortium and the purpose of their offer."       Dixons also said a U.S. Federal Court had refused a request   by counsel for Cyacq, Audio/Video Affiliates Inc &lt;AVA> and a   shareholder plaintiff to prevent Dixons from   completing its tender offer for Cyclops. It also said the court   refused to require Cyclops to provide Cyacq with confidential   information previously provided to Dixons.       On Friday Cyacq Corp, an investor group led by Audio/Video   Affiliates and Citicorp, raised their offer for Cyclops to   92.50 dlrs per share from 80 dlrs per share, if certain   conditions were satisfied.       Last week Dixons said it won out over rival bidders for   Cyclops after getting 54 pct of Cyclop's oustanding with a   90.25 dlr or 384 mln dlr tender offer that expired March 18.       On Friday, Dixons agreed to reopen its tender offer until   March 25, Wednesday.       Dixons today called Cyacq's higher 92.50 dlr a share offer   for Cyclops "highly conditional."
money-fx	MULFORD SAYS G-6 WANTS STABILITY   Treasury Assistant Secretary David   Mulford said the Paris agreement among leading industrial   nations is intended to produce "reasonable stability" in exchange   markets over the next few months.       He told a Senate Banking subcommittee the Group of Five   nations and Canada agreed in Paris to "see if there can't be a   period of reasonable stability instead of volatility" to give   time for the committments in Paris to take place.       Asked by Sen Phil Gramm (R-Tex) whether U.S. intervention   was not in fact overvaluing the dollar, Mulford replied that   the administration judged that after economic adjustments,   current exchange rates reflect underlying economic   fundamentals.       In particular, the stability sought by the nations would   allow West Germany and Japan to stimulate their economies   domestically and the U.S. to cut its budget deficit, Mulford   said in his testimony.       He stressed that a further sharp fall in the dollar would   hurt the ability of Germany and Japan to boost growth.       Mulford noted that half of West Germany's economy was   affected by international developments.       He also said increased Japanese domestic growth would   result in more U.S. exports to Japan and would not necessarily   lead to greater Japanese capital flows to the U.S., as Gramm   asserted, if Japan reformed its domestic capital market.       Commenting on the Paris agreement, Mulford said, "I think   exchange rates ought to be stabilized so (Germany's and   Japan's) efforts can be carried out.       Mulford rejected Gramm's argument that faster domestic   growth in Germany and Japan would result in an even lower   dollar.       Mulford said the administration wanted to achieve a pattern   of higher growth overseas as a way of improving the U.S. trade   deficit.       Otherwise, he said, the trade deficit would be resolved   either through a much lower dollar or a U.S. recession, both   alternatives he termed unacceptable and undesirable.

reserves	MEXICO'S RESERVES REACH EIGHT BILLION DLRS   Additional capital inflows of 1.5   billion dlrs so far this year have boosted Mexico's reserves to   about eight billion dlrs, director of public credit Angel   Gurria told reporters.       Money has been coming back to Mexico because of improved   investor confidence and because a tight monetray policy has   forced credit-starved industries to repatriate capital. Inflows   totalled a billion dlrs in fourth-quarter 1986.       Gurria said Mexico is not accumulating reserves for the   sake of it. He said its new loans will increase the pool of   funds available for badly needed investment.       Once the first tranche of its new six billion dlr loan is   drawn down in the second quarter, Mexico will still only have   enough reserves to pay for imports and debt service for four or   five months, Gurria noted.       Nevertheless, Gurria said Mexico does not expect to draw on   the commercial banks' 1.2 billion dlr investment-support   contingency facility. That money will be available until April   1988 if Mexico's export receipts and the price of oil fall   below certain levels. But Mexico failed to qualify for the   first two drawings totalling 451 mln dlrs, and Gurria said   today, "We expect we'll never have to use it."       Gurria said Mexico will know by June whether it can draw on   the second contingency facility included in the bank financing   package - a 500 mln dlr growth co-financing loan with the World   Bank.       Finance minister Gustavo Petricioli said he had signed   yesterday a 250 mln dlr loan with the World Bank to support the   development of exports of manufactured goods.       He also said the first 250 mln dlr tranche of a one billion   dlr loan from the Japanese government to support steel, oil and   export promotion will be disbursed at the end of the month.       Mexico is also due to make the third drawing from its   International Monetary Fund standby credit in the next few days   based on a successful review of end-1986 economic results.       Petricioli said Mexico is in the final stages of   discussions which will determine quantitative economic targets   for 1987 which will allow it to continue to draw from the IMF   for the rest of 1987.       Petricioli reported that Mexico has so far concluded eight   bilateral accords with government creditors within the Paris   Club.       Sixteen governments signed the Paris Club umbrella   agreement last September, which restructured 1.8 billion dlrs   of official debt, and Petricioli said he hopes to finalize   pacts with the remaining eight countries in the next few weeks.       In keeping with the spirit of the September agreement, he   said all countries from the Organization of Economic   Cooperation and Development have continued to provide export   credit facilities for Mexico, despite the debt restructuring.

trade	JAPAN DENIES BREAKING SEMICONDUCTOR TRADE PACT   Japan denied breaking a pact with the   U.S. On semiconductor trade but said prices set out in the pact   were too high and acknowledged difficulties in implementing the   accord.       "We are faithfully abiding by the ... Agreement but of   course there are some problems," a spokesman for the   International Trade and Industry Ministry told Reuters.       He said the high semiconductor prices recommended by the   agreement were leaving Japanese manufacturers piling up stocks   of unsellable products. "We are aiming to reduce production in   Japan but of course this takes time," he said.       The spokesman said some Japanese companies were selling   chips in Europe and Asia below stipulated prices, but added: "It   is only a matter of time before we solve this problem."       The eight month old pact aims to stop Japan selling large   quantities of chips at knock-down prices to the United States   and other countries and to increase U.S. Semiconductor sales in   Japan.       The U.S. Senate Finance Committee this week called on   President Reagan in a non-binding resolution to retaliate   against Japan for violating the agreement.

crude	U.K. OIL REVENUE FORECAST TO FALL IN 1987/88   The U.K. Government forecasts that oil   revenues will fall to four billion stg in the fiscal year   1987/88, from 4.75 billion in 1986/87 and 11.5 billion in   1985/86.       The forecast came in the Treasury's Financial Statement and   Budget Report issued after the Chancellor of the Exchequer   Nigel Lawson's annual budget statement to parliament.       The government is assuming the price of oil will average 15   dlrs a barrel, in line with its earlier forecasts, and its oil   revenue calculation is based on an exchange rate remaining   close to current levels, the Treasury document said.       The Treasury said the 1987/88 oil revenue shortfall will   reflect the oil price fall of 1986, as North Sea corporation   tax is paid after a time lag.       The statement calculated that a one dlr a barrel difference   in oil prices this year will change revenue by about 350 mln   stg for the current fiscal year, and 400 mln stg in a full   year.       Oil production is forecast to fall slightly in 1987,   according to the statement. A change in one mln tonnes in   production would alter revenue by about 45 mln stg in 1987/88   and 50 mln stg in a full year, it added.       Total general government receipts for 1986/87 are now   estimated to be 159.2 billion stg, 2.75 billion more than the   1986 Budget forecasts and above the Autumn Statement forecasts,   despite a shortfall of 1.25 billlion in oil receipts.       Additional non-North Sea corporation tax of 1.75 billion   stg and VAT of 750 mln stg account for the bulk of the   overshoot.       Total general government receipts were forecast to rise to   168.8 billion stg in fiscal 1987/88, and among the main items,   besides diminishing oil revenues, were projected income tax of   40 billion stg, up from 38.4 billion in the current year.

tin	U.S. DEFENDS STOCKPILED TIN SALES IN 1986   The United States defended its sales   of stockpiled tin in 1986 in reaction to criticism from   Malaysian miners who have said it violated an agreement with   southeast Asian producers.       "The United States has continued to abide by the spirit of   the memorandum of understanding and has consulted with the   ASEAN states on GSA tin disposals," a State Department spokesman   said in a statement.       "The views of the ASEAN governments have been taken into   account in determining disposal levels," the statement said.       The United States and the ASEAN countries signed a   memorandum of understanding concerning tin disposals by the   U.S. General Services Administration (GSA) in December 1983.       In its latest annual report, the States of Malaya Chamber   of Mines said the GSA sold 5,490 tonnes of tin in 1986, well   above an agreed upon annual limit of 3,000 tonnes. "The United   States appears to have lost sight of the U.S./ASEAN Memorandum   of Understanding," it said.       The State Department statement said GSA tin disposals   increased in calendar year 1986 due to changed market   conditions. During the first quarter of calendar year 1987,   they have been running at a lower rate compared to 1986.       The spokesman declined to say how much stockpiled tin the   GSA sold last year, however.

alum	KENTUCKY SMELTERS GET RELIEF ON HIGHER RATES   Owners of two aluminum smelters in   Kentucky received temporary relief from higher electric rates   after a decision Tuesday by state regulators denying a rate   hike to (Big Rivers Electric Corp) of Henderson, Ky.       But the owners of the smelters, (National Southwire   Aluminum Co) and Alcan Aluminium Ltd &lt;AL>, said further   viability of the operations would depend in part upon how the   rate case is eventually settled.       "We're hoping for no rate increases but we can't say for   sure. It's still possible we'll have to close the smelter," a   National Southwire spokesman said. He said there were other   variables to consider in any decision whether to close or   continue the smelter, located in Hawesville, about 60 miles   west of Louisville.       National Southwire is owned by National Intergroup Inc   &lt;NII>, which holds about 55 pct, and (Southwire Co), which   holds the rest, the spokesman said.       A spokesman for Montreal-based Alcan said, "The decision is   48 pages long and is in legal-ese, so it certainly will be a   long time before we can make a decision" about what it means   for the Sebree smelter in Henderson, about 100 miles west of   Louisville. "But we're delighted that Big Rivers Electric was   denied the requested rate increase."       A spokesman for the utility, a cooperative that generates   and wholesales electricity to four distributors, said the   requested increase was 7.5 mln dlrs a year over 1985 rates.       The Kentucky Public Service Commission, in denying the   increase, asked the utility to meet with creditors, which   include Manufacturers Hanover Corp &lt;MHC> and Irving Bank Corp   &lt;V>, and the smelters, to renegotiate a rate plan, the utility   spokesman said.       The commission suggested that Big Rivers Electric work out   a flexible rate schedule with the smelters that would index   their electric costs to the price of aluminum, he said.       "We have always been amenable to try, as far as we can, to   assure that the two aluminum smelters remain viable," he said.       No meetings are scheduled and none have been planned   between the utility, its creditors and the aluminum plant   owners. The commission has set a hearing on the rate issue for   July 28.

trade	U.S. HOUSE PANEL APPROVES TRADE BILL   The House Ways and Means Trade    Subcommittee unanimously approved a toned-down version of   legislation designed to toughen U.S. trade laws and wedge open   foreign markets to more U.S. goods.       The measure now goes to the full House Ways and Means   Committee next week, but major changes are not expected,   congressional sources said.       "This product could very well be toughening our trade policy   and doing it in a manner that opens markets without this   frightening word 'protectionism'," Ways and Means chairman Dan   Rostenkowski, an Illinois Democrat said.       The trade subcommittee backed away from mandating specific   retaliation against foreign countries for unfair foreign trade   practices as the House had approved in a trade bill last year.       But it held over for the full Ways and Means Committee   debate on a controversial plan by Rep. Richard Gephardt to   mandate a reduction in trade surpluses with the U.S. by   countries such as Japan, South Korea and Taiwan.       Gephardt, a Missouri Democrat, has not decided the exact   form of his amendment, an aide said. Last year the House   approved his idea to force an annual ten pct trade surplus cut   by those countries.        The trade bill will be wrapped in with legislation from   other committees dealing with relaxation of export controls,   incentives for research, expanded worker training and education   and other efforts to increase U.S. competitiveness.       The comprehensive trade bill is to be considered by the   full House in late April and then will be considered by Senate   committees.       It requires President Reagan to retaliate against foreign   unfair trade practices but do not mandate quotas or tariffs and   allow an exemption if U.S. economic security would be harmed by   U.S. actions against other countries.       The bill would make it easier for U.S. industries to win   relief from surges of imports of competitive products.       It extends until January 1993, the administration's   authority to negotiate trade agreements as part of the new   round of multilateral talks under the General Agreements on   Tariffs and Trade.       And, it includes provisions to tighten trade rules on   copyrights, patents and telecommunications goods.

trade	ECONOMIC SPOTLIGHT - U.S. CONGRESS RAPS JAPAN   The U.S. Congress is making Japan,   with its enormous worldwide trade surplus, the symbol of the   U.S. trade crisis and the focus of its efforts to turn around   America's record trade deficit.       "Japan has come to symbolize what we fear most in trade: the   challenge to our high technology industries, the threat of   government nutured competition, and the multitude of barriers   to our exports," Senate Democratic Leader Robert Byrd said.       "If we can find a way to come to terms with Japan over trade   problems, we can manage our difficulties with other countries,"   the West Virginia Democrat said at a Senate Finance Committee   hearing on the trade bill.       Byrd and House Speaker Jim Wright, a Texas Democrat, have   made trade legislation a priority this year and a wide-ranging   bill is being readied for probable House approval next month.       Japan's bilateral trade surplus jumped from 12 billion dlrs   in 1980 to 62 billion dlrs last year. Its surplus rose to 8.14   billion dlrs in February from 5.7 billion dlrs in January.       Congress points to the record 169 billion dlrs U.S. trade   deficit in 1986 and the slow response in the trade imbalance to   the dollar's decline in world currency markets as a reason to   press Japan to buy more U.S. goods.       They are particularly dismayed by the rapid deterioration   in U.S. exports of sophisticated computer technology.       In response to the growing anger and pressure by the U.S.   semiconductor industry, President Reagan Friday announced he   intended to raise tariffs as much as 300 mln dlrs on Japanese   electronic goods in retaliation for Japan's failure to abide by   a 1986 U.S.-Japanese semiconductor agreement.       Congress also has been been angered by the administration's   lack of success with Japan on a host of other trade issues   including beef, citrus, automobile parts, telecommunications   goods, and financial services.       The bulk of the House trade bill was written last week in   four committees. It is a package of trade sanctions and   measures to force the administration take tough action against   foreign trade barriers and unfair competition.       Although most provisions do not single out Japan, in many   cases their impact would be to restrict imports of Japanese   products or make them more expensive with higher duties.       The cornerstone of the trade legislation passed the House   Ways and Means Committee by a vote of 34 to 2. Its focus is to   force President Reagan to retaliate against unfair foreign   competition and to make it easier for U.S. industries to win   temporary relief from surges in imports.       The most controversial issue, an amendment to restrict   imports if countries such as Japan with large surpluses do not   buy more U.S. goods was left for an April vote by the House.       Rep. Richard Gephardt, a Democratic presidential aspirant   from Missouri, has the support of Wright and other key   Democrats to press for passage of the amendment.       The measure would have the most impact on Japan, West   Germany, Taiwan and South Korea. If Japan, for example, does   not reduce its barriers by mid-1988, the United States would   set import quotas or tariffs to cut Japanese surplus by ten per   cent a year for three years.       "I'm tired of going into companies and having managers say   to me, 'We're not over competing in Japan because we can't   compete in the marketplace.' That argument needs to be taken   away from American business," Gephardt said.       The administration has said it could not support a trade   bill containing such a provision.

The department revised downward December's sales to a 12.1   pct rise to 768,000 units from the previously reported 12.7 pct   increase.       The January decline in sales was the largest since last   October when sales fell 9.3 pct.       Before seasonal adjustment, the number of homes actually   sold in January was 53,000, up from 49,000 in December but down   from 59,000 in January, 1986.       The January fall brought home sales to a level 1.6 pct   below January, 1986, when they were a seasonally adjusted   728,000 units.       The average price was a record 127,100 dlrs, surpassing the   previous record 119,100 price set in December.       The median price of a home in January reached 100,700 dlrs   -- the first time the price has exceeded 100,000 dlrs.

earn	LUCAS SEES CONTINUED GROWTH IN SECOND HALF   Lucas Industries Plc &lt;LUCS.L> said its   underlying performance would continue to improve in the second   half but profits would be restrained by low activity in U.K.   Commercial vehicle and tractor markets as well as in North   American electronics.       The company earlier reported a two mln stg rise in pretax   profit to 40 mln in the six months to end-January. The figure   was some five mln below forecasts and Lucas shares dropped   sharply to 557.5p at 1130 GMT from last night's close of 590p.       It said it would continue with plans for all its activities   to be internationally competitive and profitable.       Costs of restructuring, reorganisation, employee training   and retraining, particularly in the UK automotive businesses,   together with high research and development spending would   affect profits in the short term.       But Lucas said it was exploiting growth opportunities in   automotive markets, especially in vehicle breaking and engine   management systems.

Hutton LBO Inc is still interested   in an acquisition of Purolator Courier Corp, and is examining   the possibility of raising its 35 dlr per share offer, an E.F.   Hutton spokesman said.       Hutton's offer was topped by a 40 dlr per share offer from   Emery Air Freight Corp &lt;EAF> earlier this week.       "We're definately not out of it at this point," the Hutton   spokesman said.       "We want to see what the offer is completely and understand   it fully, and then fashion our response," the spokesman said.       After Emery made its offer, Hutton extended the deadline on   its offer to Monday. The offer was to have expired Wednesday.       Analysts said it might be difficult for Hutton to raise the   offer since Emery, an overnight courier, might have an easier   time justifying a lofty price since it would realize cost   savings by combining its business with those of Purolator.       Purolator, a New Jersey-based overnight courier, has   declined comment.       Purolator had traded above the Hutton offer price on   speculation a new bidder would emerge. It was up 1/8 today at   40-3/8, above the Emery offer.
trade	U.S. OFFICIAL TO VISIT JAPAN AS TRADE ROW GROWS   Undersecretary of State Michael   Armacost will visit Tokyo next week for meetings with   high-level officials that will include talks on the growing   trade row over Japanese semiconductor electronics products.       He is the first high-level U.S. official to visit Japan   since President Reagan announced last week plans to impose   tariffs worth up to 30 mln dlrs on Japanese electronic goods on   April 17 in retaliation for Tokyo's alleged failure to live up   to a pact on microchip trade signed last September.       Deputy State Department spokeswoman Phyllis Oakley said the   trip is set for April 6 to 8.       U.S.-Japanese talks of this kind are regularly held each   year at this time, she told reporters.       The Armacost discussions with Deputy Foreign Minister   Ryohei Murata and other senior Japanese officials will focus on   U.S.-Japanese foreign aid programs and political security   issues of mutual concern, she added.       "Although an exchange of views on bilateral relations is   expected, the talks are not directly related to U.S.-Japanese   trade relations," she insisted.       But, in response to questions, Oakley acknowledged that   trade will be discussed.      Japan's 58.6 billion dlrs trade surplus with the United   States last year has come under fire in Congress, which is   concerned about the loss of jobs to foreign competition and   with the record 169 billion dlrs U.S. Trade deficit in 1986.

interest	U.S. CREDIT MARKET OUTLOOK - PRIME RATE   The prospect that other banks will   follow industry leaders Citibank and Chase Manhattan in raising   their prime rate is likely to cast a pall over the credit   markets today, economists said.       Bond prices had been making a smart recovery from two days   of heavy selling when Citibank surprised the market by   announcing a quarter-point increase in its prime rate to 7-3/4   pct. Chase Manhattan quickly followed.       Prices quickly fell by a full point, even though the dollar   - the market's overriding concern of late - rose sharply on the   news.       Citibank cited the higher cost of money, especially in the   Euromarket, as the reason for raising its prime rate.       Part of this rise in market rates has been caused by fears   of a tighter Federal Reserve policy to defend the dollar, but   economists said it is too early to tell whether the Fed, whose   policy-making federal open market committee, FOMC, meets this   week, is already tightening its grip on credit.       "The Fed seems to have been a bit slow in meeting the   banking system's reserve needs this statement period, but I   wouldn't conclude anything until I've seen the Fed data," said   Jeffrey Leeds of Chemical Bank.

crude:ship	IRAN WARNS U.S. NOT TO INTERVENE IN THE GULF   The speaker of the Iranian Parliament,   Hojatoleslam Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani, warned the U.S. Not to   intervene in the Gulf, a day after Washington said its warships   were available to escort Kuwaiti tankers through the waterway.       "If U.S. Intervention occurs, the entire world will become   insecure for the Americans and the events of Lebanon could be   repeated for the Americans everywhere," he said.       U.S. Defence officials disclosed in Washington yesterday   that the U.S. Navy, which has about 24 warships in or near the   Gulf, was prepared to escort Kuwaiti tankers, regular targets   for Iranian attacks in an offshoot of its war with Iraq.       Rafsanjani, in an interview reported by the Iranian news   agency IRNA, also commented on earlier U.S. Disclosures that   Iran had erected sites for new Chinese-made Silkworm   anti-shipping missiles at the Strait of Hormuz.       The agency, received in London, quoted him as saying that   Iran did not need missiles to close the strait, 24 miles wide   at its narrowest, because "we can close it with artillery only."       He added "We have the longest coasts and the highest   interest here and the small southern (Gulf) states have a   lesser interest compared with us and therefore it is natural   for us to protect the security of the Strait of Hormuz more   than others."

crude:gas:heat	SUPPLIES, MIDEAST TENSION FUEL GAINS IN OIL   Petroleum futures rallied today in a   market that was expecting declines in domestic supplies and   became further unsettled by escalated Mideast fighting.       Crude oil, gasoline and heating oil all posted gains on the   New York Mercantile Exchange, with crude oil prices matching   life-of-contract highs. Crude for delivery in May closed 17   cents higher at 18.84 dlrs a barrel.       "Crude futures could jump above 19 dlrs a barrel but will   not remain there long if products are not strong," Robert   Murphy, account executive at E.F. Hutton, said.       Traders said prices were supported by anticipation that the   American Petroleum Institute would report a decline in domestic   inventories of petroleum products in a weekly report.       Traders said prices also were supported by an escalation in   the Iran-Iraq war, with the Iranians reportedly launching a new   offensive against Iraqi positions, and Iraq attacking offshore   oil fields and an oil export depot.       Buying by speculators continued to prompt gains in gold and   silver futures on the Commodity Exchange in New York.       Gold prices retreated at midday, but rallied before the   close with support from the silver market, which was   approaching two-year highs, traders said.       Soybean futures posted strong gains on the Chicago Board of   Trade, while corn and wheat were mostly higher.       Traders said cash sales have been slow in the country, and   the soybean harvest in Brazil has been delayed by rain, which   is limiting supplies.       In addition, the Agriculture Department last week projected   a substantial drop in soybean acreage this year.     Monday's   report that the USDA inspected 46 mln bushels of corn for   export last week was unexpectedly high and, coupled with a lack   of farm sales, provided support for the corn market, traders   said.       Live hogs and frozen pork bellies rallied on the Chicago   Mercantile Exchange, while cattle ended lower.       Live hogs pushed ahead on a lack of supplies because many   farmers are turning their attention to spring planting rather   than marketing livestock, traders said, noting that cash sales   have been lighter than expected this week.       The lack of marketing also has supported pork bellies, but   prices drifted lower for moderate losses in nearby months as   speculators sold contracts to take profits, traders said.       Cattle prices closed lower but continued to show strength   related to tight supplies.       Prices pushed ahead to new contract highs, extending gains   past three-year peaks set Monday, as tight supplies forced meat   packers to bid aggressively for available animals.       However, some traders sold contracts to take profits after   the extended rally, which has seen the April delivery contract   soar to 69.90 cents a pound from 56 cents a pound at the start   of the year.       New York coffee futures closed higher on trade talk Brazil   would not be an aggressive seller near term, analysts said.

Partly offsetting these inflows, bills for repurchase by   the market will drain some 785 mln stg while bills maturing in   official hands and the treasury bill take-up will remove about   546 mln stg.

This compares with the Bank's present band one dealing rate   of 10-3/8 pct.

A decline in U.S. Transatlantic traffic following terrorist   attacks in Europe, the U.S. Bombing of the Libya, the Chernobyl   disaster and a slump in the oil industry which affected Middle   East traffic were the main causes of the loss, Thomson said.       He said the poor results were caused by "a range of   exceptional circumstances wholly outside our direct control" and   predicted a return to profitability this year.       Last year, the airline was forced to axe 1,000 jobs, sell   some of its assets and cut the number of its flights across the   Atlantic and to the Middle East following the fall in business   .

The meeting was attended by representatives from Brazil,   Mexico, Guatemala, El Salvador, Honduras, Costa Rica and   Nicaragua. A Panamanian representative attended the meeting as   an observer.       Representatives at the meeting said efforts would continue   to be made to reach a regional consensus on export quotas which   could be presented to the International Coffee Organization.

acq	UNION TO PROTEST DART'S SUPERMARKETS &lt;SGL> BID   The United Food And Commercial   Workers said that more than 1,000 rank-and-file members of the   union will demonstrate Monday at Dart Group Corp's headquarters   protesting Dart's proposed 1.73 billion dlr takover of   Supermarkets General &lt;SGL>.       Supermarkets is best known for its Pathmark chain of   supermarket drug stores in the New York and New Jersey area and   also owns Rickels home centers.       The union said that it is firmly against the Dart bid   because "workers have always ended up with a raw deal in the   current takeover mania."       A Union statement said: "We do not intend to allow our   members to pick up the tab for Supermarket General's executives   and the bankers or the Dart Group who stand to make millions."       Dart is controlled by the Haft family of Washington, which   last year made a bid for California-based Safeway Stores Inc.   The Hafts lost, but walked away with at least 100 mln dlrs in   profits, analysts estimate.       The union said that Dart's Safeway bid forced a major   restructuring at Safeway to pay the Hafts and their lawyers and   caused a loss of thousands of jobs.
earn	GULF STATES (GSU) SEES END TO CASH BY MAY   Gulf States Utilities Co said   its condition has "significantly deteriorated" and that its   operating cash reserves will be inadequate by May 1987 unless   it receives additional financing or rate relief from state   public utilities commissions in Texas and Louisiana.       In the company's newly-released annual report and 10-K   filing, Gulf States said its bank lenders had notified the   utility last month that no additional credit would be granted.   Gulf States said the banks had requested the utility to begin   making prepayments by the end of April of 45 mln dlrs more than   the estimated 1987 lease payments of 40 mln dlrs.       "The circumstances increase the likelihood that the company   may have to seek protection from its creditors under the   bankruptcy code," Gulf States said.       The utility had previously said it might be forced to   consider filing for bankruptcy because of limited rate   increases granted by state regulators in connection with Gulf   States' 4.3 billion dlr River Bend nuclear plant in Louisiana.       "If the regulatory commissions approve the company's   proposed rate moderation plan and grant the increases provided   for in such plan during the initial three-year phase-in period,   the company believes it could achieve financial stability,"   Gulf States said.       In February, the Texas Public Utilities Commission granted   Gulf States an interim rate increase of 39.9 mln dlrs   contingent upon the utility obtaining a new 250 mln dlr line of   credit to pay operating expenses. The utility had sought 144.1   mln dlrs in rate hikes in Texas.       Gulf States has appealed a decision by Louisiana state   regulators rejecting its application for 100 mln dlrs in   emergency rate relief.       In 1986, Gulf States earned 244.9 mln dlrs on revenues of   1.47 billion dlrs, compared to profits of 265.4 mln dlrs on   sales of 1.85 billion in the previous year.
trade	ECONOMIC SPOTLIGHT - JAPAN PUSHES ITS CHIPMAKERS   Japanese microchip makers are being   strong-armed into compliance with a U.S.-Japan pact on   semiconductors halting predatory pricing and opening Japan's   market to foreign chips, industry analysts said.       But doubts remain over whether the Ministry of   International Trade and Industry (MITI), which is pressuring   the firms, can successfully battle market forces and whether   the U.S. Industry is geared up to take advantage of any   breathing space, they said.       U.S. Threats to scrap the agreement signed last September   have pushed MITI to try harder to get recalcitrant Japanese   chipmakers to abide by the pact, the analysts said.       "MITI has been moving hot and heavy throughout the industry   to get things done," said Bache Securities (Japan) associate   vice president Peter Wolffe.       Last month, MITI told chipmakers to cut production for the   January to March period by 10 pct to help dry up inexpensive   chips that have escaped from Japan to grey markets not subject   to the pact's price controls.       The ministry also asked electronics firms to provide   distributors with certificates designating them as authorised   exporters, in an effort to close loopholes through which grey   marketeers sneak chips out of Japan, market analysts said.       U.S. Trade negotiators here last week said the pact was in   jeopardy because of continued dumping in non-American markets   and little sign of increased foreign sales in Japan.       But major Japanese firms appear to have agreed to the   production cuts, several analysts said. Last week, NEC Corp   said it would cut production in line with MITI's request.       "NEC has been the most aggressive in resisting MITI's   demands," said David Keller, analyst at James Capel and Co. "Once   NEC cuts production, it means they all have."       Still, pressures remain to keep production high. Japanese   firms need high output to cut unit prices for U.S. Sales that   the Commerce Department assigns them under the pact.       "The best way to lower cost is to produce more," said Salomon   Brothers Asia Ltd analyst Carole Ryavec.       Preparations for a possible upturn in demand could also   spur higher production next quarter, Merrill Lynch analyst Matt   Aizawa said.       Grey marketeers may also be able to outfox any new   restrictions, some industry officials said.       "It's like tax avoidance schemes," said Steve Donovan, head   of MMI Japan K.K. "As soon as you close one route, another   opens."       MITI's pressure has annoyed some makers, who had earlier   shrugged off MITI guidance.       "It's getting to be like communism," said one.       But analysts said output cuts could help by making it   easier to increase prices as planned on April 1 and forcing   firms to stop extending market share by selling at a loss.       "They're going to have to start running their businesses   like businesses," Bache's Wolffe said.       MITI has also been conducting a highly public campaign   urging chip users to buy foreign-made chips, but U.S. Industry   officials said response has been mixed at best.       "There has been some change, but it's not across the board,"   said one U.S. Spokesman. "The companies have a varying degree of   urgency."       The ultimate impact of all these efforts by MITI on the   troubled U.S. Industry remains in doubt, analysts added.       Pressure to cut production of 256 kilobit DRAM (dynamic   random access memory) chips could merely speed the transition   to one megabit chips, where Japan now leads, analysts said.       Whether U.S. Firms are able to stage a comeback in memory   chips, or interested in doing so, also remains unclear, they   said.       Analysts are watching with interest the fate of a new U.S.   Consortium which hopes to challenge Japan by developing the   most advanced technology for microchip manufacturing.       Even in the thorny area of access, much depends on U.S.   Commitment as well as on Japanese openness, some said.       "The SIA (U.S. Semiconductor Industry Association) doesn't   even have an office here," a source close to the industry said.   "You could question just how committed they are."       In addition, some industry analysts question the   effectiveness of a bilateral agreement that leaves out third   country chipmakers such as those in South Korea.       "(South) Korea's gaining market share," said one analyst.   "They're the real winners from the agreement."

trade	GATT COUNCIL DEFERS DECISION ON SEMICONDUCTORS   The ruling GATT Council deferred a   decision on whether to set up a dispute panel on the basis of a   European Community complaint against the U.S.- Japanese   agreement on exports of computer semiconductors.       David Woods, spokesman of the General Agreement on Tariffs   and Trade (GATT), told a news briefing that the main parties   would continue bilateral talks. This was in the hope of   resolving the row before the next Council meeting on April 15.       The five-year accord signed in July 1986 aims to protect   the U.S. Market from dumping of low-price Japanese microchips,   officially known as semiconductors.       The E.C. Complained the accord breached GATT trade rules by   allowing Tokyo to monitor prices, allowing it to set minimum   prices for Japanese chips sold in third countries.       The 12-nation Community also charged the agreement gave   U.S. Producers preferential access to the Japanese market.       Woods said many nations -- Hong Kong, Canada, Switzerland,   Singapore, Sweden, Malaysia and Nigeria -- had supported the EC   complaint during the heated Council debate.       Japan's delegate, Minoru Endo, and U.S. Ambassador Michael   Samuels replied in the debate that the E.C. Charges were   unfounded, but they were willing to continue bilateral talks.

Volcker said that given a choice between squeezing the   budget deficit or squeezing investment, he would favor   squeezing the budget deficit.

earn	FIRST INTERSTATE &lt;I> ESTIMATES BRAZIL RISKS   First Interstate Bancorp said its   1987 pre-tax income could be reduced by about 33.5 mln dlrs if   it decides to reclassify its 339 mln dlrs in medium- to   long-term loans to Brazil as nonperforming.       But the company stressed in a filing with the Securities   and Exchange Commission that it believes it is too soon to   reclassify the debt, despite Brazil's Feb 20 suspension of   direct interest payments on medium- and long-term loans.       "The corporation believes that it is premature to make a   decsion to classify such medium- and long-term debt as   nonperforming at this time," First Interstate said.       But First Interstate said that if Brazil's suspension of   interest payments continues, it may have to reclassify its   loans as nonperforming and place them on non-accrual, meaning   that interest previously accrued but not paid would be deducted   from net income and interest would no longer be accrued.       Besides its medium- and long-term debt, First Interstate   said it also has 165 mln dlrs in short-term loans or trade   lines in Brazil.

trade	NEXT WORLD TRADE NEGOTIATIONS MUST SUCCEED - NZ   Ministers from more than 20   nations were told by New Zealand that the next international   negotiations on liberalising trade would be the last this   century and the cost of failure could not be measured.       Trade minister Mike Moore told his colleagues at a   welcoming ceremony before two days of talks here that great   progress had been made in preparing for the negotiations which   must not be sidetracked.       "We live in troubled and dangerous times for the world   trading system," he said.       "We have seen that the failure of the world trading system   has caused great depression and conflict in the past. Our   failure to maintain the momentum will be at great cost to us   all," Moore said.       He added: "The cost of failure is beyond calculation. It is   our last hope and best opportunity this century. We will not   get another chance before the year 2000."       The ministers are in New Zealand to review world trade   since the "Uruguay round" talks last Sepember. The meeting is   also part of preparations for a full-scale conference of the   General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) in Venice in   June.       The Uruguay meeting is considered by most countries to have   been particularly successful, with northern hemisphere   countries managing to have service industries such as banking   and insurance included in the next full round.       The southerners' goal of including agricultural and   tropical products also was met.       The meeting at this North Island tourist resort is   described by participants as informal and no declaration is   expected.       Moore said one aim was to "instil a sense of political   urgency to avert potential economic tragedy."       Another was to seek ways of popularising freer trade to   people who felt the pain of readjustment but could not see the   benefits, as well as preventing "bush fires of confrontation   while we proceed with orderly negotiations."       The meeting is being attended by 25 overseas delegations   including representatives of GATT and the Economic Community.       The delegates include U.S. Trade Representative Clayton   Yeutter.       American sources say he is ready to state that the best way   to reverse protectionist sentiment in the United States is to   implement four key Uruguay proposals:       -- an end to agricultural subsidies;       -- inclusion of trade in services and investments in GATT   regulations;       -- tightening of restrictions on pirating of so-called   intellectual property such as trademarks, patents and   copyrights;       -- new rules to resolve trade disputes among GATT's 92   member states.       Earlier, New Zealand sources had said French Foreign Trade   Minister Michel Noir had pulled out of the informal GATT talks   for domestic political reasons.       Cabinet chief Bernard Prauge will lead the French   delegation.

crude	OPEC REAFFIRMS COMMITMENT TO FIXED PRICES, CEILING   OPEC has reaffirmed its commitment to   fixed crude oil prices of around 18 dlrs a barrel and an   overall output ceiling of 15.8 mln barrels per day (bpd) to   defend prices, its president Rilwanu Lukman said.       He told a news conference here "After due consultation with   my colleagues in OPEC, I hereby wish to emphasize that Nigeria   and all member countries of OPEC remain determined to uphold   the December agreement by adhering strictly to their various   quotas and official selling prices."       Lukman added no extraordinary OPEC conference was planned.       "We are in a position to re-confirm that, despite misleading   news in foreign media to the contrary, ... OPEC member   countries as a whole produced below their agreed quota in the   month of February," Lukman, who is Nigerian oil minister, said.       Lukman put the overall OPEC output shortfall in February at   900,000 bpd and said this was as a result of their firm   determination to defend official selling prices of 18 dlrs   agreed upon last December in Geneva.       The December agreement set an overall output ceiling for   OPEC of 15.8 mln bpd for first half 1987 and restored fixed   prices as from February 1 around a reference point of 18 dlrs.       Oil prices rallied immediately after the Geneva accord but   fell again last month on reports that OPEC was producing more   than the agreed level.       "The idea was to suggest that OPEC's agreement would not   hold and this caused some customers to hold back purchases of   OPEC oil and resort to destocking to meet their needs," Lukman   said.       He said the 900,000 bpd shortfall last February was based   on the verified figure for 10 out of OPEC's 13 members, adding   that Nigeria alone had a shortfall in production of 100,000   bpd.       Iraq disassociated itself from the December agreement,   while the production figures of Ecuador and the United Arab   Emirates needed to be verified, Lukman said.       "If that is the price we have to pay to make the agreement   succeed, we are ready ... OPEC is not changing its price level   of 18 dlrs," the group's president said.       He said the OPEC price differentials committee meeting   formerly postponed to April had been put off indefinitely.       "Furthermore, no extraordinary meeting of the conference is   at the moment contemplated since most agreements reached in   December are being adhered to," he said.       Asked if the committee did not need to meet soon to narrow   the gaps in the prices of the various OPEC crudes -- fixed in   relation to the 18 dlr benchmark -- Lukman replied "We consider   the defence of our prices much more crucial than differentials."       Lukman said OPEC was aware that consumers had heavily drawn   on stocks of both crude oil and refined products to levels well   below this time last year and soon they would return to the   market in search of crude.       "We don't see that there is going to be any difficulty in   maintaining the 18 dlr price throughout the rest of the year,"   Lukman said.       The OPEC president praised non-OPEC oil producers, which he   said had contributed to the group's efforts to stabilise   prices, but he criticised Britain for maintaining its long-held   view not to do anything to help the market.       "We are quite confident, however, that in the long-term with   two-thirds of the world's reserves in OPEC hands, the future is   ours. We will use that advantage responsibly," he said.       Lukman described the disruption in Ecuador's output   following an earthquake as tragic, but refused to say if the   South American country would be allowed a higher output quota   when it recovered from the disaster.
coffee:crude:grain:iron-steel:tea:trade:wheat	INDIA STEPS UP COUNTERTRADE DEALS TO CUT TRADE GAP   India is searching for non-communist   countertrade partners to help it cut its trade deficit and   conserve foreign exchange.       Wheat, tobacco, tea, coffee, jute, engineering and   electronic goods, as well as minerals including iron ore, are   all on offer in return for crude oil, petroleum products,   chemicals, steel and machinery, trade sources told Reuters.       Most of the impetus behind countertrade, which began in   1984, comes from two state trading firms -- the State Trading   Corp (STC) and the Minerals and Metals Trading Corp (MMTC).       "The two state trading corporations are free to use their   buying power in respect to bulk commodities to promote Indian   exports," a commerce ministry spokeswoman said, adding that   private firms are excluded from countertrading.       One trade source said India has targetted countries that   depend on an Indian domestic market recently opened to foreign   imports.       However, countertrade deals still make up only a small part   of India's total trading and are likely to account for less   than eight pct of the estimated 18.53 billion dlrs in trade   during the nine months ended December, the sources said.       Countertrade accounted for just five pct of India's 25.65   billion dlrs in trade during fiscal 1985/86 ended March,   against almost nothing in 1984/85, official figures show.       However, the figures exclude exchanges with the Eastern   Bloc paid in non-convertible Indian rupees, the sources said.       Total trade with the Soviet Union, involving swaps of   agricultural produce and textiles for Soviet arms and crude   oil, is estimated at 3.04 billion dlrs in fiscal 1986/87,   against three billion in 1985/86.       Indian countertrade, which is being promoted mainly to help   narrow the country's large trade deficit, is still   insignificant compared with agreements reached by Indonesia,   Venezuela and Brazil, the trade sources said.       The trade deficit, which hit an estimated record 6.96   billion dlrs in 1985/86, is expected to decline to 5.6 billion   in the current fiscal year.       But the push to include non-communist countries in   countertrade is also due to other factors, including the slow   growth of foreign reserves, a tight debt repayment schedule,   shrinking aid and trade protectionism, businessmen said.       One source said India is showing more dynamism in promoting   countertrade deals than in the past, when the deals were made   discreetly because they break GATT rules. As a member of the   General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT), India cannot   officially support bartering.       The MMTC's recent countertrade deals include iron ore   exports to Yugoslavia for steel structures and rails.       "MMTC's recent global tenders now include a clause that   preference will be given to parties who accept payment in kind   for goods and services sold to India," a trade official said,   adding that the policy remains flexible.       "We also take into account other factors such as prices at   which the goods and services are offered to India," the trade   official said.       Early this year the commerce ministry quietly told foreign   companies interested in selling aircraft, ships, drilling rigs   and railway equipment to India that they stood a better chance   if they bought Indian goods or services in return, the trade   sources said.       Illustrating the point, the official said a South Korean   firm recently agreed to sell a drilling platform worth 40 mln   dlrs to the state-run Oil and Natural Gas Commission.       In return, the South Koreans gave a verbal assurance to buy   Indian goods worth 10 pct of the contract, against the 25 pct   sought by New Delhi, the trade official said.       "We selected the Korean firm because its bid was the lowest,"   he added.       Countertrade is helping African countries short of foreign   currency to import goods. India has signed a trade protocol to   buy up to 15,000 tonnes of asbestos fibre from Zimbabwe in   exchange for Indian goods, including jute bags and cars.       But despite India's new drive, countertrade has some   inherent problems, they added.       "It is not always easy to meet the basic requirement that   the trade should always be balanced," one trade source said. "The   other problem is it is often difficult to supply or buy   commodities which the other party wants."       Another added, "Barter is also restrictive.

grain:oilseed:soybean:veg-oil:wheat	LDC FOOD AID NEEDS DECLINE IN 1986/87 - USDA   Total food aid needs in 69 of the   least developed countries declined in 1986/87, as requirments   fell in many countries in Africa, the Middle East and Asia, the   U.S. Agriculture Department said.       In a summary of its World Agriculture Report, the   department said grain production in sub-Saharan Africa was a   record high in 1986, with gains in almost every country.       However, food needs in Central America rose, worsened by   drought-reduced crops and civil strife.       Record wheat production in 1986/87 is pushing global wheat   consumption for food to a new high, and higher yielding   varieties have been particularly effective where spring wheat   is a common crop, it said.       However, may developing countries in tropical climates,   such as Sub-Saharan Africa, Southeast Asia, and Central   America, are not well adapted for wheat production, and   improved varieties are not the answer to rising food needs, the   department said.       World per capita consumption of vegetable oil will rise in   1986/87 for the third straight year.       Soybean oil constitutes almost 30 pct of vegetable oil   consumption, while palm oil is the most traded, the department   said.

The spokesman quoted Wallis as saying drastic measures   would be needed to stave off protectionist legislation by   Congress.       Wallis, who is attending a sub-cabinet-level bilateral   trade meeting, made the remark yesterday in talks with Saito.       Wallis was quoted as saying the Reagan Administration wants   Japanese cooperation so the White House can ensure any U.S.   Trade bill is a moderate one, rather than containing   retaliatory measures or antagonising any particular country.       He was also quoted as saying the U.S. Would be pleased were   Japan to halve restrictions on agricultural imports within five   years if the country cannot cope with abolition within three,   the spokesman said.       Japan currently restricts imports of 22 agricultural   products. A ban on rice imports triggered recent U.S.   Complaints about Japan's agricultural policy.

acq	HUGHES TOOL DIRECTORS REJECT MERGER WITH BAKER   The directors of Hughes Tool Co   &lt;HT> said they would recommend to shareholders that they reject   a merger with Baker International Corp &lt;BKO> today.       Hughes vice-president Ike Kerridge said the recommendation   would be put to shareholders at a meeting scheduled for 10 A.M.   Local time (1600 GMT) to discuss the proposed merger.       Kerridge said the board met yesterday to discuss the merger   but decided against it.       The Hughes board objected to a U.S. Department of Justice   requirement that Baker sell off several specialised   subsidiaries in businesses related to oil-drilling.       The Hughes board last week indicated that it might cancel   the merger because of the Department of Justice requirement.       The board of directors of the California-based Baker had   approved the merger. On February 17 Baker said it had signed an   agreement to sell one of the subsidiaries.       The companies had been given until April 22 to comply with   the Justice Department requirement, Kerridge said.

gnp	WORLD BANK REPORT CRITICISES PERU ECONOMIC PLAN   a confidential world bank report on the   peruvian economy said the government's strategy does not offer   good prospects for medium and long-term growth and is likely to   quickly lead to inflation.       The report, published today by an economic monthly, the   peru report, said the success of president alan garcia's   government in stimulating output last year to achieve eight pct   gross domestic product growth "represents gains in the short   term at the expense of the long."       Government officials had no immediate comment on the   report, which advised a reduction in the overall size of the   public investment programme and greater emphasis on the   preservation of peru's export potential.       The report said that although the government had succeeded   in cutting inflation 50 pct a year in the first half of 1985 to   under 70 pct, its stabilisation and reactivation programme was   encountering increasing difficulties.       "an early renewal of inflationary pressures, linked to   monetary expansion, exchange rate devaluation and an easing of   price controls, appears not improbable," it added.

In a statement with its 1986 results, the company said its   information and entertainments sector's Financial Times, FT,   newspaper had record sales and profits.       The FT is subject to a 70 mln stg investment programme,   with the printing and publishing operation moving to a new   plant in the London docklands next year.       Its other key sectors are merchant banking, oil and china.       Commenting on its Camco Inc oil service subsidiary, Pearson   said it believes the oil business setback is only temporary.       The group has been acquiring oil properties in both the   U.S. And Britain which will begin to make a significant impact   on profits in the 1990s.

acq	HUGHES &lt;HT> APPROVES MERGER WITH BAKER &lt;BKO>   An overwhelming majority of Hughes Tool   Co shareholders approved a merger agreement with Baker   International Corp based on revised terms that allow the   companies additional time to sell a drilling bit business as   required by the U.S. Justice Department.        Hughes chairman William Kistler said the revised terms of   the proposed consent decree also set a 10 mln dlr cap on how   much funding the newly combined companies will have to spend on   the disputed drilling bit business until it is sold.       An earlier proposed consent decree did not establish a   funding limit.       The Baker-Hughes merger, which would would create a 1.2   billion dlr oilfield services company, almost fell through   earlier this month when Hughes balked at terms of a proposed   Justice Department consent decree that would have given the   companies only three months to find a buyer for the Reed   business.       Baker said today it would withdraw the one billion dlr   lawsuit it had filed to force Hughes to follow through with the   merger.       Hughes' Kistler, speaking to reporters after 85 pct of   Hughes' shareholders approved the merger, said the revised   terms of the agreement give the companies six months to find a   buyer for the Reed drilling bit business. The previous   agreement had proposed a three-month period.       Kistler said the the government had also indicated it would   consider granting, if necessary, an additional three-month   extension to complete the sale.       He said there were "several people looking" at the domestic   drilling bit business.       The companies, Kistler said, have also decided to   voluntarily sell a Reed plant in Singapore.       Kistler estimated that the merger, which should be   completed in about two weeks, will result in annual cost   savings of about 50 mln dlrs. He said he expects "substantial   cutbacks" in the 20,000-member workforce at Baker-Hughes Inc,   the name the merged company will take.       Kistler said the cost savings and greater efficiencies   should put the company on a profitable course. "We think that   in the third or fourth quarter after the merger we should see   something close to breakeven," he said.       In the fourth quarter of 1986, Hughes earned 31.7 mln dlrs   on sales of 215.7 mln dlrs.       Baker, in its first fiscal quarter ended December 31, lost   34.2 mln dlrs on revenues of 297.7 mln dlrs.

Treasury Financial Secretary Norman Lamont made the   announcement to Parliament. He said, "The government's policy is   to sell its minority holdings in companies as and when   circumstances permit.       "As part of this policy I am now able to announce that,   subject to market conditions, the government will sell its   remaining shares in BP during the 1987/88 financial year."       The last sale of British government shares in BP was in   September 1983. The government currently holds some 578.5 mln   ordinary shares in the company.       Lamont said the Treasury would appoint financial advisers   for the sale. Merchant banks and stockbrokers interested in   being considered for this would be interviewed in early April.       In September 1983, the U.K. Government sold 150 mln shares   in an underwritten offer for sale by tender. The striking price   then was 435 pence - 7.5 pct above the minimum tender price, a   Treasury spokesman said.       He said the sale of BP shares would not cut across the   government's plans to privatise Rolls-Royce, in either April or   May, or the sale of BAA Plc, the British airports authority   which is slated for privatisation in either June or July.

ship	IRAN SAYS IT INTENDS NO THREAT TO GULF SHIPPING   Iran said reports that it intended to   threaten shipping in the Gulf were baseless, and warned the   U.S. And other countries not to interfere in the region.       Tehran radio, monitored by the BBC, quoted a Foreign   Ministry spokesman as saying any attempt at interference would   be met by "a strong response from Iran and other Moslems in the   world."        U.S. Defence Secretary Caspar Weinberger, in remarks   apparently unrelated to the broadcast, said the U.S. Would do   whatever was necessary to keep shipping lanes open in the face   of new Iranian anti-ship missiles in the Gulf.       The U.S. State Department said two days ago Tehran had been   told of U.S. Concern that Iranian anti-ship missiles posed a   threat to the free flow of oil from the Gulf.       U.S. Officials have said Iran has new Chinese-made   anti-ship "Silkworm" missiles, which pose a greater threat to   merchant ships than missiles used before.       The Iranian spokesman said the reports that Iran intended   to attack ships were "misleading propaganda."       He said Iraq's President Saddam Hussein was the main cause   of tension in the Gulf and said Iran would continue to use "all   its legitimate means to stem the cause of tension."       Weinberger said in a television interview in the U.S. "We   are fully prepared to do what's necessary to keep the shipping   going and keep the freedom of navigation available in that very   vital waterway."       "We aren't going into any disclosures or discussions of what   might happen, but we are certainly very sympathetic to and   listening carefully to any suggestions for our assistance in   keeping navigation free in that area," he said.       Weinberger said U.S warship movements in the Gulf area were   not unusual.       A U.S. Navy battle group led by the aircraft carrier Kitty   Hawk is currently in the northern Arabian Sea.       The Iranian spokesman was quoted by Tehran radio as saying   the U.S. Was trying to build up its military presence in the   region.
palm-oil:veg-oil	INDONESIA TO IMPORT PALM OIL, FEARS MAY SHORTAGE   Indonesia has issued licences to   traders to import palm oil to avert a possible shortage of   cooking oil during the Moslem fasting month of Ramadan in May,   Trade Minister Rachmat Saleh told Reuters.       "We have given permission for a small amount of imports to   prevent a shortage during Ramadan," he said. He gave no figures   for the amount of palm oil to be imported, but said it would   come from Malaysia.       Indonesia, the world's second largest palm oil producer,   earlier denied it had granted palm oil import licences.       Saleh was replying to a question from Reuters after traders   in London said Indonesia had issued licences to import around   135,000 tonnes of palm oil for delivery in April.       Indonesia, with 168 mln people, is the world's largest   Moslem country. During Ramadan Moslems fast during the day and   have large meals after sunset.       Indonesian crude palm oil exports in the first 11 months of   1986 were 469,100 tonnes, according to central bank figures,   against 652,000 tonnes in the whole of calendar 1985.       Indonesia is expanding palm oil output, and Saleh did not   explain why there might be a shortage during Ramadan.

Japan imported 128,089 tonnes of Brazilian beans in   calendar 1986, Finance Ministry customs-cleared statistics   show.       The sources said Brazilian beans were cheaper than U.S.   Origin which may account for the heavy purchases, but added   there were concerns about deliveries from Brazil in the near   term due to labour problems there.       The Japanese purchases comprise 30,000 tonnes for April   20/May 10 shipment, 102,000 for May, 15,000 for late May/early   June, 36,000 for June, and 31,000 for late June/early July   shipment, the sources said.       As a result of the large volumes of Brazilian beans   purchased, Japanese crushers will buy a total of only 150,000   tonnes of U.S. Beans for May shipment. Some 100,000 of this   shipment has already been purchased, the sources added.       They said crushers bought some 270,000 to 280,000 tonnes of   U.S. Beans for April shipment.

Sigma said the reserves are equivalent to 10 years future   production at current milling rates.       The reserves comprise 1,640,779 tons proven reserves   grading an average of 0.163 ounces of gold a ton and 3,262,161   tons probable reserves grading an average of 0.127 ounces of   gold a ton.       Sigma said it changed its 1986 reserve reporting method   following Dome Mines' previously reported move to adopt general   industry practice of reporting proven and probable ore   reserves.       Prior to 1986, Sigma conservatively reported only proven   reserves that could be mined without future development costs.       Proven reserves as of December 31, 1985 were 978,000 tons   grading an average of 0.194 ounces of gold a ton, equivalent to   about two years future production.

trade	AUSTRALIAN MINISTER SAYS AGRICULTURE GATT PRIORITY   Australian Trade Minister   John Dawkins said if the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade   (GATT) does not give high priority to agricultural trade reform   it will be neglecting the area of greatest crisis.       In a statement to the informal GATT trade ministers   conference here he said agriculture is a problem which involves   all countries and seriously affects the debt servicing   abilities of a number of developing countries.        He said major countries should be showing leadership on   this problem.       "We will be giving close attention to the processes in the   OECD (Organisation of Economic Cooperation and Development) and   elsewhere leading to the Venice economic summit where we will   be looking to the participants to adopt a strong commitment to   agricultural trade reform," Dawkins said.       The Venice summit is scheduled for June.       He said Australia's interests in the Uruguay Round, the   eighth under the GATT, are wide ranging. Dawkins said he sees   the round as providing a timely opportunity to secure further   meaningful trade liberalisation in all sectors and to restore   confidence in the multilateral system.       Dawkins said initial meetings of the negotiating groups   established in Geneva after the GATT declaration last September   in Punta del Este, Uruguay, have made a reasonable start, but   it is vital that trade ministers maintain the pressure on these   processes.       "We must see that the commitments made at Punta del Este on   standstill and rollback are carried into practice."       The standstill and rollback of protection offers the global   trading system a chance to hold and wind back protection during   the negotiations which are expected to last up to four years,   he said.
trade:veg-oil	PHILIPPINES CRITICISES EC FOR VEGETABLE OIL LEVY   Philippines Trade and   Industry Secretary Jose Concepcion told world trade ministers   he wondered if their agreement was of any real value after the   European Community (EC) imposed a levy on vegetable oils.       Concepcion, speaking at an informal meeting of the General   Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) here, said ministers   declared in Uruguay last September that the trade of   less-developed nations should not be disrupted.       He said the EC not only ignored Manila's request for lower   tariffs on coconut oil but introduced a levy on vegetable oils   and fats that are vital exports for Southeast Asian countries.       Concepcion said while the levy might be rejected by the EC   Council of Ministers, he noted that "I cannot help but wonder   whether the agreements we produce in meetings like this are of   any real value."       He also said industrialised nations saved about 65 billion   U.S. Dlrs in 1985 through low commodity prices, but this had   affected the ability of developing nations to import goods and   services.       "The health and the growth of world trade requires that the   new development of developing countries losing their share of   world trade be arrested and reversed," he said.

grain	ILLINOIS CO-OP FUTURES DISSOLUTION VOTE SET   The shareholders of Illinois   Cooperative Futures Co., the futures trading arm of many   Midwest farm cooperatives for more than 25 years, will vote   Wednesday on its possible dissolution.       The directors of the company called a special meeting and   recommended its dissolution last month, citing falling volume   and increasing costs.       Sources close to the organization told Reuters the pullout   of Growmark, Inc., which holds more than 70 pct of the capital   stock, led to the call for dissolution.       The possible demise of the cooperative has set clearing   houses scrambling for the trading business of the 85 regional   and local cooperatives that comprise its membership.       Ironically, it was Growmark, at that time a regional farm   cooperative with major river terminal elevators, that founded   Illinois Cooperative Futures on December 1, 1960.       But Growmark became affiliated last year with Archer   Daniels Midland of Decatur, Ill., and markets its grain through   a joint subsidiary of the two companies, ADM/Growmark.       With that relationship, Growmark no longer needs to trade   futures through the cooperative, said Tom Mulligan, president   of the co-op.       Membership in the company, which Mulligan termed a   cooperative of cooperatives, has declined from 99 in 1982. A   notable loss was AgriIndustries of Iowa, which became   affiliated with Cargill, Inc.       Illinois Co-op's other members include such regional   cooperatives as Indiana Grain, based in Indianapolis, Goldkist,   of Atlanta, Ga., Midstates in Toledo, Ohio, Farmland Industries   in Kansas City, Mo., Farmers Commodities, Des Moines, and   Harvest States in Minneapolis.       Some observors said the demise of Illinois Cooperative   Futures Co. is a serious blow to the cooperative system.       Instead of banding together, the individual cooperatives   are forced to go their own ways, said the floor manager of one   cash house at the Chicago Board of Trade.       Such a move would destroy the cohesiveness that gives farm   cooperatives an advantage in the market at a time that a few   major commercial companies are growing dominant, he said.       Don Hanes, vice president for communications with the   National Council of Farm Cooperatives, said 5,600 cooperatives   exist today, down from 6,700 five years ago.       "The period we've gone through in the past five years has   been quite a crunch," he said. "There's been a lot of   consolidation in the marketing co-ops."       One problem, he said, is the co-ops sell the grain to the   major commercials for export, rather than exporting it   themselves, losing potential profits.       But exporting grain requires heavy investments, and the   multi-million-dollar loss posted six years ago by Farmers   Export Co., a co-op set up to export grains, served "to make   folks gun-shy," Hanes said.       Mulligan said he believes the dissolution, if it is   approved, is a result of change in the futures industry rather   than a change in U.S. agricultural economics.       A grain dealer at one member co-op said the futures arm   "was a convenience, something that saved us a little bit of   money. (Its dissolution) will force us to change our way of   doing business."       "We're sorry to see the co-op go by the wayside," he said.   "But there are lot of people out there to do business with.   There are plenty of capable firms."       Steven W. Cavanaugh, vice president for grain marketing   with Indiana Grain, said he would prefer to trade futures   through a Chicago-based cooperative.       "In terms of clearing our business as a unit as opposed to   individuals, there would be economic savings," he said but   added, "The times change and with changing times, come   different opinions of what businesses ought to be around."       Cavanaugh said the possible demise of the futures arm had   nothing to do with its profitability. "I would guarantee you   that this company is not in trouble. It is a sound, healthy   organization."       In the year ended February 28, 1986, the Illinois   Cooperative reported income of 10.2 mln dlrs and members'   equity, or net worth, of 8.3 mln dlrs. The annual report for   the most recent year has not been filed.       Under the cooperative system, income from operations is   returned as "patronage refunds" to the members.       Income and refunds in the past five years have been   declining. In the year ended February 28, 1982, the co-op   reported income of 17.4 mln dlrs and patronage refunds of 17.0   mln dlrs. Patronage refunds in the year ended February 28,   1986, totalled 9.5 mln dlrs.       "You're dealing with substantially lower volume," Mulligan   said. "Lower volume translates into higher costs."       According to the company's 1986 annual report, Growmark   owns 90 pct of the preferred shares and four pct of the common   shares of Illinois Cooperative Futures Co.       Mulligan declined to speculate on how much of the capital   Growmark is entitled to. He said he could not determine the   figure unless the shareholders decide in favor of dissolution.   Equity is distributed according to each member's trading volume   and, as a result, changes from year to year.       However, Mulligan said the company could continue to meet   minimum capital requirements to trade futures even if Growmark   pulled out.

earn	ENDOTRONICS &lt;ENDO> EXPECTS LOSS FOR YEAR   Endotronics Inc said it expects to   incur "substantial losses" for the second quarter ending March   31 and fiscal year ending Sept 30, 1987.       As one factor behind the anticipated loss, Endotronics   cited a dispute by one of its Japanese distributors, &lt;Yamaha   Inc>, over payment of a 3,686,000 dlr promissory note.       In a Form 8-K filing with the Securities and Exchange   Commission, Endotronics said the note was for overdue accounts   receivable from sales of instruments to Yamaha and another   Japanese distributor during the company's 1986 fiscal year.       Endotronics said at its present reduced level of operations   it will exhaust all currently available cash and credit   facilities in early May 1987. It said this assumes full use of   the remaining 1,250,000 dlrs available under a line of credit   from Celanese Corp, which requires approval of Celanese Corp   &lt;CZ>.       The company said its ability to obtain funding was   adversely affected by a suit filed March 4 by two of its   shareholders seeking to represent a class of holders against   three officers of Endotronics.       Endotronics said the complaint against it alleges   violations of the federal securities laws in connection with   statements made in the company's annual and quarterly reports.       The company also said the Securities Division of the   Minnesota Department of Commerce is conducting an inquiry into   the company's Japanese sales for fiscal 1986 and trading by   insiders and brokers in the company's common shares.       It said similar inquiries are being conducted by the   Securities and Exchange Commission. The investigations will   hurt the company's ability to obtain funding, it said.       As a result of the dispute over payment of the promissory   note, the law suit challenging its financial data and the   various investigations concerning insider trading, the company   said it no longer expects that anticipated declines in   instrument sales in Japan in fiscal 1987 will be offset by   increased instrument sales in other foreign countries and the   United States.

coffee	INDONESIA PRESSING FOR COMPROMISE OVER COFFEE   Indonesian coffee exporters are   preparing for a period of depressed prices while urging their   government to lobby for a resolution of the deadlocked issue of   export quotas, the chairman of the Association of Indonesian   Coffee Exporters (AICE) told Reuters.       Dharyono Kertosastro said in an interview that Indonesia,   the world's third largest producer, is trimming costs and   improving its marketing while seeking a compromise on quotas.       "But as long as Brazil sticks to its hardline position, we   can never bridge the gap," Dharyono said.       Indonesia was one of a group of eight producing countries,   along with Costa Rica, the Dominican Republic, Ecuador,   Honduras, India, Papua New Guinea and Peru, which proposed a   new quota system at last month's failed International Coffee   Organistion (ICO) talks in London.       Brazil, which would have had its quota reduced under the   Group of Eight scheme, blocked the proposal.       AICE officials are now hoping Colombia can use its contacts   with Brazil to suggest a compromise.       Edward Muda, an AICE official who attended the ICO   negotiations, said Latin American members of the Group of Eight   were in contact with Colombia, the world's second largest   producer, but gave no details.       "Colombia has shown interest because they will gain from a   compromise. Without one, they will suffer if the present market   stays like it is," Muda said.       He said Indonesia was in contact with consumers such as the   U.S., Japan, the Netherlands, West Germany and Canada ahead of   an ICO executive board meeting scheduled for April 1.       Dharyono said the AICE will send delegations to the U.S.   And Japan to brief Indonesian embassy officials there and press   them to present Indonesia's case more firmly.       He urged the Indonesian government to do more to help the   country's coffee traders through the ICO negotiations.       Muda said the Group of Eight had some common ground with   the big consumers because they agreed on the need for basing   quotas on what he termed "realistic criteria."       The breakaway group believes the old quota system, which   gives Brazil a 30 pct share of the quota exports, does not   reflect up-to-date supply and demand trends.       Brazil has stuck rigidly to its insistence that the old   system be applied.       Export quotas were suspended in February 1986 when market   prices surged because of the failure of the Brazilian crop.       Although prices have long since come down to a point where   export controls could be reintroduced, producers and consumers   at the 75-member ICO have not been able to agree on new   guidelines. Brazil and the U.S., The largest consumer, are both   refusing to alter their positions.       Dharyono said if new quotas are not agreed he believed   Indonesia was well placed to survive low prices.       Indonesian farmers are trimming production costs and the   AICE is improving its marketing system, Dharyono said.       Indonesia's coffee output in 1986/87, ending September 30,   is expected to stagnate or fall slightly from last year's level   of 360,000 tonnes, he said.       He said stocks, at 90,000 tonnes, were about average for   the time of year.
crude	ENERGY/CALIFORNIA OIL PRODUCTION   Drilling for oil in California is   likely to continue at last year's sharply reduced levels   despite recent gains in crude oil prices, industry analysts   said.       Because much of the crude oil in California fields is   thick, heavy and expensive to extract, oil prices would have to   increase to near 1985's levels before any significant recovery   is seen in drilling, they said.       "Companies will probably only drill their best prospects,"   said John Curti, an analyst with Birr Wilson Securities Inc.       Few new wells now are being drilled.       Only 33 rigs, about one-quarter of the total available,   were drilling for oil onshore in California last week, compared   to about 70 last year, said Bill Bolster of Munger Oil   Information Services, which tracks California drilling   activity.       "It's in the dregs right now," said Bolster of the state's   drilling activity.       Current prices are not enough to justify increased   drilling, said Ed Malmgreen of the California Independent   Producers Association.       While an Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries pact   to curb production boosted oil prices early this year, prices   eventually fell.       Prices for California's marker grade, Line 63 blend, have   slumped about 20 pct in the last month to 14 dlrs from a high   of about 17 dlrs.       More than half of California's oil comes from stripper   wells, those producing less than 10 barrels a day, and that   much of that oil costs between 18 and 25 dlrs a barrel to   extract, Malmgreen said.       "It's not unusual for a stripper well to cost 18 dlrs,"   Malmgreen said.       Many stripper wells along the southern California coast   produce eight times as much water as crude oil, and inland   wells frequently require the use of steam injection to spur   extraction of the thick, heavy oil, he said.       The outlook for future production in California is clouded   by a lack of exploratory drilling now, analysts said.       In the heart of California's oil patch, Kern County, which   produces about two-thirds of the state's oil, exploratory   drilling has slowed to a crawl.       Only 55 exploratory wells were drilled in Kern County in   1986, compared to 137 in 1985, according to David Mitchell of   the state energy commission. So far this year only five   exploratory wells have been drilled.       "I don't think they'll even get to what they did last   year," Mitchell said.       No pickup in exploratory drilling is likely for the rest of   the decade, Mitchell said.       Along with the fall in drilling has come a decrease in the   number of producing wells and overall production.       Between February and October of 1986, the number of   producing oil wells in California fell 14 pct to 43,521 from   more than 50,000, said Bill Guerard of the California Energy   Commission.       In line with that decrease, California's crude oil output   fell about 10 pct last year due to low oil prices and is   expected to remain at that lower level, analysts said.       Between February and October 1986, California's crude oil   production slipped from an all-time high of 1.185 mln barrels   per day to 1.066 mln bpd, Guerard said.       Total estimated crude oil production in California for 1986   was 408 mln bbls, compared with 424 mln bbls in 1985 and 405   mln bbl in 1983, according to the California Department of   Conservation.       "Production in 1987 will probably hold around 1986 levels,"   Guerard said.
earn	LAENDERBANK EXPECTS MODEST PROFIT RISE IN '87   Oesterreichische Laenderbank AG   [OLBV.VI] expects to maintain its dividend and to record a   moderate rise in profits this year after the 181.5 mln   schilling net profit made in 1986, General Director Gerhard   Wagner said.       Wagner told a news conference that last year's 34.3 pct   rise in net profit from 135.1 mln in 1985 was largely due to   greater domestic business and wider margins on schilling   interest rates.       The bank, Austria's third largest, raised its 1986 dividend   to 12 pct of its 1.5 billion schilling nominal share capital   from 10 pct on capital of 1.35 billion in 1985.       Announcing the 1986 results, Wagner said: "We will endeavour   to maintain the higher dividend in 1987."       Laenderbank's balance sheet total rose five pct to 197.7   billion schillings against 8.1 pct growth in 1985. Foreign   currency business last year accounted for some 37 pct of   balance sheet total compared with about 41 pct in 1985.       Wagner blamed the realtive shrinkage of foreign business   chiefly on the dollar's fall against the schilling, which is   effectively pegged to the mark. The dollar's weakness had wiped   some 8.9 billion schillings off the balance sheet total.       Wagner declined to give an exact figure for profits from   the bank's London branch, which opened in April 1985, but said   that it came close to one mln stg.       On schilling lending, profit on interest had risen 18 pct   to 2.19 billion schillings while commission earnings climbed   8.7 pct to 738.9 mln.       According to the 1987 federal budget, the state is due to   lower its stake 60 pct in Laenderbank, probably to 51 pct.   Wagner said the exact timing of the move depended on the state.
money-fx	SUMITA SAYS BANK WILL INTERVENE IF NECESSARY   Bank of Japan Governor Satoshi Sumita   said in a statement the central bank will intervene in foreign   exchange markets to stabilise exchange rates if necessary in   close cooperation with other major industrial nations.       Sumita said the Bank will take adequate measures including   market intervention, if necessary, in line with the February 22   Paris agreement by six major industrial nations.       Canada, Britain, France, Japan, the U.S. And West Germany   agreed to cooperate in stabilising exchange rates around   current levels. Sumita's statement was issued after the dollar   slipped below 150 yen to hit a record low of 148.40.       "It is inevitable that exchange rates fluctuate under the   system of floating rates," Sumita said.       The fact the dollar plunged below 150 yen does not mean   anything significant under the floating system, he said.       The six nations agreed in Paris exchange rates prevailing   then were broadly consistent with underlying economic   fundamentals and further substantial rate shifts could damage   growth and adjustment prospects in their countries, the Paris   statement said.

acq	CHRYSLER &lt;C> DEAL LEAVES UNCERTAINTY FOR AMC WORKERS   Chrysler Corp's 1.5 billion dlr bid to   takeover American Motors Corp &lt;AMO> should help bolster the   small automaker's sales, but it leaves the future of its 19,000   employees in doubt, industry analysts say.       It was "business as usual" yesterday at the American Motors   headquarters, one day after the proposed merger was unveiled by   Chrysler and AMC's French parent Renault, according to company   spokesman Edd Snyder.       But AMC's future, to be discussed at a board meeting today,   would be radically different as a Chrysler subsidiary than if   it had continued with the state-run French car group as its   controlling shareholder.       Industry analysts said the future of AMC's car assembly   plant in Kenosha, Wis., and its Toledo, Ohio, Jeep plant would   be in doubt if the overcapacity predicted in the North American   auto industry by the early 1990s comes to pass.       Both plants are far from "state of the art" for car   manufacturing sites, and AMC has a history of poor labor   relations at each.       "Chrysler doesn't need that many new plants," said Michael   Luckey, automotive analyst for the Wall Street firm Shearson   Lehman Brothers. "They probably will close the Toledo plant and   move Jeep production to Canada."       Ronald Glantz of Montgomery Securities said that at the   very least, the new owner of the Toledo plant would be able to   wring concessions from the United Automobile Workers union   local representing Jeep workers.       "The UAW won't be able to hold them up for ransom as they   have AMC because during a down year, Chrysler will have   underutilized facilities to transfer production," he said.       Analysts said they foresaw no major complications that   would abort a combination which historians said would be the   auto industry's biggest merger since American Motors was formed   in 1954.       AMC was in need of a financial savior because of its losses   of more than 800 mln dlrs since 1980 and pressures in France   for Renault to cut its backing. The company had said it could   not forecast consistent profitability until 1988 at the   earliest.       In announcing the takeover agreement, Chrysler chairman Lee   Iacocca cited AMC's Jeep division as well as its new 675 mln   dlr assembly plant at Bramalea, Ontario, and its network of   1,200 dealers as the major attractions.       Analysts reasoned that Chrysler might feel moved eventually   to sell off or close some of the older plants to cut overhead   costs in view of the new debts and liabilities it would incur   in the AMC buyout.

"We believe our members' interests can be well served   within the Chrysler family, and we are committed to making that   happen," UAW president Owen Bieber and vice president Marc   Stepp said in a statement.

The UAW is negotiating with AMC over the carmaker's demand   for economic concessions covering workers at its Wisconsin   operations, without which AMC has said it would cease vehicle   production at its Kenosha, Wisconsin, assembly plant by 1989.
lumber	USDA'S AMSTUTZ "SYMPATHETIC" TO WOOD CREDITS   U.S. Agriculture Undersecretary   Daniel Amstutz said he was "totally sympathetic" with U.S. wood   producers' desire to have their exports eligible for government   credit guarantees.       But he told the Senate Appropriations Agriculture   subcommittee that including wood products in the department's   short- or intermediate-term export guarantee programs would   conflict with U.S. multilateral trade obligations.       Currently, U.S. wood products are not eligible for   government export credit guarantee because they are considered   "manufactured products," Amstutz said.       He said USDA had devoted an "enormous amount" of time to   considering making wood products eligible for the guarantees   and that Congress was considering a measure to do so.
cocoa	ICCO GROUP LOOKS AT COCOA BUFFER STOCK RULE PLAN   The International Cocoa Organization,   ICCO, buffer stock working group began examining a draft   proposal for buffer stock rules this afternoon, delegates said.       The plan, presented by ICCO Executive Director Kobena   Erbynn, represented a compromise between producer, European   Community, EC, and other consumer views on how the buffer stock   should operate, they said.       The proposal involved three key principles. First, the   buffer stock manager would be open to offers for cocoa rather   than using fixed posted prices as previously, delegates said.       Under an offer system, the buffer stock manager would be   free to choose cocoas of varying prices, they said.       The second provision was that non-ICCO member cocoa could   comprise a maximum 10 pct of the buffer stock, while the third   laid out a pricing system under which the buffer stock manager   would pay differentials for different grades of cocoa, to be   set by a formula, the delegates said.       After the plan was presented, working group delegates met   briefly in smaller groups of producers, EC consumers and all   consumers to look at the proposal. Producers gave no reaction   to the scheme and will respond to it when the working group   meets tomorrow at 1000 GMT, producer delegates said.       Consumer members accepted the proposal as a good base to   work from, one consumer delegate said.       Delegates said the proposal was only a starting point for   negotiations on buffer stock rules and subject to change.
gnp	GERMAN RESEARCH INSTITUTE LOWERS GROWTH FORECAST   The DIW economic research institute   said West German economic growth in 1987 is unlikely to reach   the 1.5 pct rate it had forecast earlier this year.       The institute, whose forecasts are more pessimistic than   those of the other four leading German institutes, said the   economy had passed its peak in the summer of 1986, and its   prospects had dimmed significantly since the autumn.       The DIW repeated earlier predictions that gross national   product (GNP) in the first quarter of 1987 would contract in   real, seasonally adjusted terms against the weak final quarter   of last year.

acq	GENCORP &lt;GY> BID COULD BE RAISED, GROUP SAYS   An investor group said it might be   willing to raise its 100 dlr per share offer for GenCorp but so   far the company has turned down requests for a meeting.       "We might be able to see some additional value if we could   meet" and get more financial data, said Joel Reed, speaking for   the investor group.       Reed told Reuters that GenCorp chairman A. William Reynolds   "was not interested in sitting down and talking with us at this   time." Cyril Wagner sought the meeting in a recent telephone   conversation with Reynolds, Reed said.       Wagner and Brown, along with AFG Industries Inc &lt;AFG>,   recently launched a surprise tender offer for GenCorp. The   offer is worth 2.23 billion dlrs.       Reed said under the circumstances the 100 dlr per share   tender offer, which expires April 15, is a fair offer. GenCorp   gained 3-1/2 to 114 today on the NYSE.       Reed outlined a plan to reshape GenCorp in the event his   group wins control. He said aerospace, soft drink bottling and   entertainment units are potential divestiture candidates. He   said the tire business, which the group wants to keep, may be   more viable if merged with another tire company.       "One option would be to try to grow the tire business   through combination or an acquisition," Reed said. He said he   believes such a merger could create a stronger force in the   tire industry.       Gary Miller, chief financial officer of AFG, said his   company has a record of acquiring mature businesses and   boosting productivity. Automation and incentives tied to profit   sharing have been used with success, he said.       In the case of GenCorp's RKO General broadcasting stations,   Reed said the plan of the partners is to step into GenCorp's   shoes and proceed with plans to  sell the stations.       The partners said if they succed in acquiring GenCorp they   intend to consummate sale of WOR-TV in New York to MCA Inc   &lt;MCA>. GenCorp last year entered into an agreement to sell the   station for 387 mln dlrs.       The partners also said if they acquire Gencorp they would   also proceed with the proposed sale of KHJ-TV in Los Angeles to   Walt Disney Co &lt;DIS>. RKO General would receive 217 mln dlrs   and Fidelilty Television, which challenged the license, would   get about 103 mln dlrs.       The partners also said the Federal Communications   Commission established an expedited schedule for receiving   comments on their request for special temporary authorization   of proposed trust arrangements while the FCC considers a formal   application for transfer of the broadcast unit.       Reed said he was pleased with the expedited schedule   because it provides time for the agency to act on the request   before the expiration of the tender offer.       He said it was the aim of the partners to move as quickly   as possible to eliminate uncertainty surrounding the stations.       Asked about criticism of the takeover attempt voiced by   some municipal officials in Akron, Ohio, where GenCorp is   headquartered, Reed said, "the plan of the partners offers long   term growth for Ohio."       He noted that the aerospace business, slated for   divestiture under the partners' plan, is located in California.   "Our program is one that overall would provide the greatest   long term growth for all segments," he said.

The bonus was made to First Interstate Trading Co and will   be paid to the exporter in the form of commodities from CCC   stocks, the department said.       An additional 7,959 head of dairy cattle are still   available to Egypt under the Export Enhancement Program   initiative announced September 12, 1986, it said.

interest	PHILIPPINES SEES 1987 GOVERNMENT REVENUE UP 26 PCT   Philippine government revenue is   expected to rise 26 pct to 99.9 billion pesos this year from   79.1 billion in 1986, Finance Secretary Jaime Ongpin said.       In a report to President Corazon Aquino on his department's   performance during the year ended February 28, Ongpin said at   least 15.9 billion pesos were expected to accrue from new tax   reform measures announced last year.       He said the goal for official development assistance (ODA)   this year is two billion dlrs, adding that aid donors have   committed ODA inflows of 1.7 billion dlrs in 1987, up 30 pct   from 1.3 billion in 1986.       Ongpin said steps planned to provide a sound revenue base   included a value added tax (VAT) system due to be introduced in   1988. He gave no other details.       He said treasury bill maturities, interest rate levels and   the volume of government securities sold to the private sector   have improved significantly. "In particular, short-term prime   interest rates which had gone over 40 pct in 1985, are now down   to less than 10 pct," he said.       Ongpin said the government's debt-equity scheme, introduced   in August last year, had attracted more than 276 mln dlrs worth   of applications, but selective evaluation had resulted in   approvals of only 61.8 mln dlrs at end-February.       He said his department aims to accelerate its privatisation   program and the sale of non-performing assets owned by   associates of former President Ferdinand Marcos to achieve a   1987 sales target of four billion pesos which would help   finance land reform.       Aquino said earlier this month that all the 24 billion   pesos the government hopes to raise from the sale of the failed   companies will be used to finance the land reform plan.       Ongpin also said the government would pursue efforts to   obtain 500 mln dlrs in concessional funding for the program   from a World Bank-led consultative group of multilateral and   bilateral aid donors.       The government has said the land reform plan aims to   distribute 9.7 mln hectares of land to poor peasants.

coffee	COLOMBIA BLASTS U.S. FOR COFFEE TALKS FAILURE   Colombian finance minister Cesar Gaviria   blamed an inflexible U.S. position for the failure of last   week's International Coffee Organisation, ICO, talks on export   quotas.       "We understand that the U.S. Position was more inflexible   than the one of Brazil, where current economic and political   factors make it difficult to adopt certain positions," Gaviria   told Reuters in an interview.       The U.S. and Brazil have each laid the blame on the other   for the breakdown in the negotiations to re-introduce export   quotas after being extended through the weekend in London.       Gaviria stressed that Colombia tried to ensure a successful   outcome of the London talks but he deplored that intransigent   attitudes, both from producing and consuming nations, made it   impossible.       In a conversation later with local journalists, Gaviria   said the U.S. attitude would have serious economic and   political consequences, not necessarily for a country like   Colombia but certainly for other Latin American nations and for   some African countries.       He told Reuters that Colombia, because of the relatively   high level of its coffee stocks, would probably suffer less.       According to Gaviria, Colombia can hope to earn about 1,500   mln dlrs this calendar year from coffee exports, which   traditionally account for 55 pct of the country's total export   revenue.       That estimate would represent a drop in revenues of 1,400   mln dlrs from 1986.       Colombia, which held stockpiles of 10.5 mln bags at the   start of the current coffee year, exported a record 11.5 mln   bags in the 1985/86 coffee year ending last September 30.

sugar	TURKEY SEEKING 100,000 TONNES SUGAR - TRADE   Turkey is holding a buying tender for   100,000 tonnes of white sugar on March 24, traders here said.       The sugar is being sought for early arrival and will   probably be met with April/May shipment sugar, they added.       Earlier today newspapers in Turkey carried an advertisement   from Turkish Sugar Factories inviting offers of 100,000 tonnes   of crystal sugar with a 50 pct option to increase or decrease   the amount.       Over the 1983/85 period Turkey each year has exported   between 240,000 and 350,000 tonnes of whites to Iran and   between 62,000 and 230,000 tonnes to Iraq.       Following lower sugar crops in the past two years analysts   said Turkey needs to import sugar now if it is to continue   filling these export contracts, and may need to buy more.       Last month London broker C Czarnikow estimated Turkish   1986/87 production at 1.42 mln tonnes raw value against 1.4 mln   in 1985/86 and an average 1.76 mln in the previous three   seasons.       The semi-official Anatolian Agency recently quoted Turkish   Minister of Industry and Trade Cahit Aral as saying Turkey   would export 100,000 tonnes of sugar this year and import the   same amount.

Around 140 grain handlers stopped work, 125 of them at the   two Europoort locations of Graan Elevator Mij (GEM), which   handles about 95 pct of grain, oilseeds and derivatives passing   through Rotterdam.

coffee:ship	BRAZIL COFFEE EXPORTS DISRUPTED BY STRIKE   An 11-day-old strike by   Brazilian seamen is affecting coffee shipments and could lead   to a short term supply squeeze abroad, exporters said.       They could not quantify how much coffee has been delayed   but said at least 40 pct of coffee exports are carried by   Brazilian ships and movement of foreign vessels has also been   disrupted by port congestion caused by the strike.       A series of labor disputes and bad weather has meant   Brazil's coffee exports have been running at an average two   weeks behind schedule since the start of the year, one source   added.       By the end of February shipments had fallen 800,000 bags   behind registrations, leaving around 2.4 mln bags to be shipped   during March. By March 10 only 230,000 bags had been shipped,   the sources said.       Given Brazil's port loading capacity of around 100,000 bags   a day, even if normal operations were resumed immediately and   not interrupted by bad weather, some March registered coffee   will inevitably be shipped during April, they added.

corn:grain	TRADERS EXPECT SHARP DROP IN U.S. CORN ACREAGE   Grain trade analysts expect a sharp   drop in corn acreage, with most expecting a more modest decline   in soybeans, in the U.S. Agriculture Department, USDA,   plantings intentions report due out at 1500 est (2100 gmt).       The average trade guess for 1987 planted corn acreage was   66.06 mln acres, ranging from 60.7 to 69.0 mln, all well below   the 76.67 mln planted last year due to improved incentives by   the USDA for farmers to retire acres. Corn acres totalled only   60.22 mln in 1983, when the PIK program was introduced.

carcass:sugar	EC EXTENDS PARTS OF FREE FOOD FOR POOR SCHEME   A scheme to distribute surplus food   free to the poor in the European Community (EC), which was due   to expire next Tuesday, will be partially extended for a   further month, an EC Commission spokesman said.       He added the executive Commission has not yet decided   whether the scheme should become a permanent feature of the   EC's struggle to find a use for its massive stocks of farm   produce.       Almost 60,000 tonnes of cereals, sugar, beef, butter and   other food have been authorised for distribution under an   operation sanctioned by EC farm ministers on January 20 in   which charities act as executive Commission agents.       The original idea was to help the needy survive this year's   unusually cold European winter.       The spokesman said the Commission was extending the scheme   fully in Greece, which has recently been hit by unseasonal   snowstorms, for the month of April.       Other EC countries would be authorised to use stocks of   food for which they have already applied under the scheme up to   April 30. The spokesman said this would enable distribution of   flour, semolina, sugar and olive oil at a relatively high rate   next month.       He said the Commission, which has powers to continue most   aspects of the scheme without consulting ministers further,   will be considering soon whether it should be made permanent.       Cost, which has already reached around 65 mln European   currency units, would be a major consideration.

interest:money-fx	LAWSON REMARKS DASH HOPES OF EARLY U.K. RATE CUT   Chancellor of the Exchequer Nigel   Lawson's remarks yesterday suggesting there are precise   exchange rate targets for the pound undermined sterling,   dashing hopes for an early cut in U.K. Base rates, analysts   said.       But the market's reaction, testing exchange rate levels   indicated by Lawson, was probably overdone and the longer term   outlook for sterling remained bullish, they agreed.       In an apparent break with the previous policy of secrecy,   Lawson told a National Economic Development Council meeting he   was comfortable with sterling exchange rates around current   levels, specifying rates of around 1.90 marks and 1.60 dlrs.       Lawson added the U.K. Government intended to keep sterling   at about present levels, using currency intervention and   interest rates to achieve this.       The February 22 Paris agreement of the Group of Five and   Canada to stabilise exchange rates is widely believed to   include target ranges, but all participants to the meeting had   so far refused to specify these.       Markets were quick to react to the statement, chopping   about one U.S. Cent and over one pfennig off the pound to match   the levels mentioned by Lawson.       But most analysts polled said they did not believe Lawson's   statement signalled a change in U.K. Policy.       Keith Skeoch, chief economist at stockbrokers James Capel   and Co, said, "the remarks have been blown out of proportion.   Lawson is paying now for a little bit of a slip of the tongue."       Barclays de Zoete Wedd economist Mark Brett said, "there is   nothing great and fantastic in the Chancellor's statement."       He said he did not believe the rates indicated by the   Chancellor were precise targets, but merely represented central   rates around which sterling would be allowed to fluctuate,   perhaps by as much as 10 pct.       "It would be insane to pinpoint an exchange rate ahead of an   election ... I don't believe Lawson is mad enough to tie   himself to a fixed rate," Brett said.       Currency markets were keen for official statements to   clarify the scope of the Paris accord and reactivate currency   trading. This mood easily led to over-reaction, analysts said.       "Making similar statements when the market is high strung   and ready to bounce is perhaps a mistake," one senior dealer   with a U.S. Bank said.       Capel's Skeoch said, "it gives the foreign exchange markets   something to shoot at."       "It is obvious that the government, as a member of the Group   of Six, has agreed exchange rate bands. But they are not cut in   stone, they can change with time," Skeoch said.       Brett said, "we think the 2.90 marks level is a central   rate. Give or take 10 pfennigs and all is fine."       Not all analysts played down the significance of the   remarks, however. Chris Dunn, economist at Royal Bank of   Canada, said the remarks may signal a decisive move to insulate   sterling from the fortunes of the dollar.       Although about two-thirds of Britain's trade is conducted   with European countries, sterling has traditionally shadowed   the dollar rather than the mark, analysts noted.       "Britain must decide whether it wants to follow the U.S. Or   throw in its lot with Europe," Dunn said.       "It suggests that while the U.K. Is not actually applying to   join the European Monetary System, it is seeking protection by   shadowing it ... The Bundesbank has made it clear that it wants   the U.K. To clarify its position relative to the mark," he said.       Analysts said sterling's dip on currency markets following   Lawson's remarks made an early half-point cut in U.K. Base   rates from current 10 pct levels unlikely in the short term.       "Over the next three weeks, a cut is out, unless we get some   extremely good economic indicators," Capel's Skeoch said.       Base rates have been cut twice by one-half point in March,   the last after the March 17 budget presentation, and analysts   had been expecting another half point cut shortly afterwards.
interest:money-fx:money-supply	SPAIN RAISES CALL MONEY RATES ON HIGHER DEMAND   The Bank of Spain raised overnight call   money rates by 1/4 to 14 pct on demand for 746 billion pesetas   in today's auction, which a bank spokesman termed "heavy."       Rates stood at 12.1 pct at the start of the year and have   been increased to drain liquidity on rising demands for funds,   the spokesman said.       He said in reply to Reuters inquiries that rates could rise   further if money supply growth rose above this year's eight pct   target for M-4, defined as liquid assets in public hands.       Money supply rose at an annualised rate of 16.7 pct last   month against 8.1 pct in January. Growth was 11.4 pct in 1986.       A leading Spanish broker said the central bank was applying   a more restrictive policy to keep the lid on inflation.       The consumer price index rose 8.3 pct last year.       "Money supply control is the government's chief weapon   against inflation," he said. "The problem is higher rates are   attracting liquidity from abroad."       He said this was why the central bank enacted specific   measures to control the inflow of foreign capital. The Bank of   Spain earlier this month imposed a 19 pct reserve requirement   on new convertible peseta funds held by banks to curb   short-term speculative capital from abroad.
cpi	SWEDEN REVISES DOWN JANUARY'S INFLATION FIGURE   Sweden's rate of inflation during   January has been revised downwards after a fault was made in   calculating the figures, the Central Bureau of Statistics said.       The January rise in consumer prices was 1.0 pct instead of   the previously announced 1.3 pct, the bureau said, without   explaining how the error arose.       Consumer prices in February rose 0.3 pct compared with 0.1   pct in February last year, the bureau said. The total inflation   rate so far this year is therefore 1.3 pct, allowing for   January's revised figures, it added.       Year-on-year inflation rose to 3.4 pct in February, against   a revised 3.2 pct in January and a year-on-year rate of 5.3 pct   in February 1986, the bureau said.       The slowdown in price rises was mainly due to a government   imposed price freeze which came into force on February 4, the   bureau added.

grain:wheat	EC SOURCES SAY UK WHEAT PLAN YET TO BE APPROVED   The European Commission has not taken a   decision on applications from the British government for the   release of 200,000 tonnes of intervention feed wheat onto the   British market in May and June, Commission sources said.       They said last week's cereals management committee agreed   to release 70,000 tonnes of feed wheat through weekly tenders   between April 14 and May 26. It also indicated it planned to   allow the release of another 30,000 tonnes from April 23.       However, it decided to leave consideration of the release   of further wheat until later.       The British government had applied for the release of a   further 100,000 tonnes in both May and June from British   intervention stores to prevent market prices rising.       However, the sources said, the Commission wanted to review   the market situation nearer the time before giving its   approval.       The Commission was given new powers last year to control   the release of intervention cereals onto the market, the   sources noted.       Following last week's committee meeting, the U.K. Ministry   of Agriculture said the Commission had given an assurance that   additional quantities of intervention wheat would be made   available in May and June. It also said that it was envisaged   that monthly releases would be at least 100,000 tonnes,   depending on the state of the market.       This lead to the widespread assumption that the Commission   had actually approved the release of 300,000 tonnes during the   three months of April, May and June at last week's meeting.
trade	CANADA OUTLINES GATT AGRICULTURAL REFORM PLAN   Canadian Trade Minister Pat   Carney said that agricultural policies should not hurt world   international trade and should therefore become more price   responsive over time.       She told delegates at the informal meeting of trade   ministers that this was one of five principles Canada wanted   adopted in reforming agriculture in the General Agreement on   Tariffs and Trade (GATT). Secondly, support for agriculture   should avoid production incentives, and thirdly, countries   should freeze and seek to reduce government aid measures that   distorted world prices, Carney said.       Carney said the fourth principle was that countries should   not introduce new import barriers not mandated by existing   legislation and the fifth was that these basic principles must   be implemented collectively.       Carney later told Reuters the Canadian guidelines are   basically compatible with the seven point Australian proposals   announced in Davos, Switzerland, in January.       European trade sources said the conference welcomed the   Canadian initiative but some delegates, and not only the   European Community, voiced reservations about some of the   principles.       Carney said there was a lot of political will among the   ministers here to complete the Uruguay Round of GATT in under   four years and that there is also a realisation that it has to   be done in a balanced way.       "The consensus view was to proceed as fast as we can on a   broad front and see what areas emerge where we can get early   conclusion," she said.       However, the meeting did not identify what those areas are,   Carney said.  She said Canada/U.S. Bilateral trade   negotiations, which must be concluded at least in draft form by   October, are progressing well.

gnp:reserves	SOUTH AFRICA GDP UP 4.7 PCT IN 1986 LAST QUARTER   The South African Reserve Bank,   confirming previous estimates, said real gross domestic product   in the 1986 fourth quarter grew at a seasonally adjusted annual   rate of 4.7 pct versus 4.6 pct in the third quarter and 1.3 pct   in the 1985 final quarter.       The bank, in its latest quarterly review, said the nominal   growth rate for the year did not quite reach one pct after a   1.5 pct contraction in 1985.       But it said when the strengthening of the terms of trade is   taken into account, the real GNP in 1986 advanced by 1.5 pct   compared with a decrease of 0.5 pct in 1985.       GDP is the total value of goods and services produced by an   economy but omits income from abroad.  GNP includes such   payments or outflows.       The bank also said there were indications the country's   economic recovery was becoming more broadly based.       With the exception of commerce all major sectors of the   economy contributed to the fourth quarter rise in domestic   production.       The bank said major increases in foreign reserves were   recorded in January, February and the first half of March 1987.   Reserves rose by 1.70 billion rand during January and February.       Total reserves in 1986 declined by 189 mln rand to 5.70   billion rand and were equivalent to about 14.5 pct of the total   annual value of import payments.       The current account surplus amounted to 7.20 billion rand   in 1986 versus 5.90 mln the previous year.       The bank said continuing strength of the current account   has allowed foreign reserves to be "rebuilt to more comfortable   levels."       "This has strengthened the authorities' hands in lending   support to the exchange rate of the rand if such action were to   be called for," the bank said.

acq	REDSTONE DETAILS SWEETENED VIACOM &lt;VIA> OFFER   Investor Sumner Redstone, who leads   one of the two groups vying for control of Viacom International   Inc, offered to sweeten his bid for the company by 1.50 dlrs a   share cash and 1.50 dlrs in securities.       In a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission,   Redstone, who controls Dedham, Mass.,-based National Amusements   Inc, a theater chain operator, offered to raise the cash   portion of its Viacom offer to 42 dlrs a share from 40.50 dlrs.       Redstone also raised the face value of the preferred stock   he is offering to 7.50 dlrs from six dlrs.       The Redstone offer, which is being made through Arsenal   Holdings Inc, a National Amusements subsidiary set up for that   purpose, which also give Viacom shareholders one-fifth of a   share of Arsenal common stock after the takeover.       Viacom said earlier today it received revised takeover bids   from Redstone and MCV Holdings Inc, a group led by Viacom   management which is competing with Redstone for control of the   company and already has a formal merger agreement with Viacom.       The company did not disclose the details of the revised   offers, but said a special committee of its board would review   them later today.       The Redstone group, which has a 19.5 pct stake in Viacom,   and the management group, which has a 5.4 pct stake, have both   agreed not to buy more shares of the company until a merger is   completed, unless the purchases are part of a tender offer for   at least half of the outstanding stock.       The two rivals also signed confidentiality agreements,   which give them access to Viacom's financial records provided   they keep the information secret.       In his SEC filing, Redstone, who estimated his cost of   completing the takeover at 2.95 billion dlrs, said Bank of   America is confident it can raise 2.275 billion dlrs.       Besides the financing it would raise through a bank   syndicate, Bank of America has also agreed to provide a   separate 25 mln dlr for the limited purpose of partial   financing and has committed to provide another 592 mln dlrs,   Redstone said.       Merrill Lynch, Pierce Fenner and Smith Inc has increased   its underwriting commitment to 175 mln dlrs of subordinated   financing debt for the Viacom takeover, from the 150 mln dlrs   it agreed to underwrite earlier, Redstone said.       Redstone said his group would contribute more than 475 mln   dlrs in equity toward the takeover.       The Redstone equity contribution to the takeover would   consist of all of his group's 6,881,800 Viacom common shares   and at least 118 mln dlrs cash, he said.

money-fx:trade	YEUTTER SAYS BUDGET CUT KEY TO BETTER U.S. TRADE   A reduction of the U.S. federal budget   deficit will be needed to help eliminate the nation's huge   trade deficit, U.S. trade representative Clayton Yeutter said.       Speaking to the New York Chamber of Commerce and Industry,   Yeutter said "Capital and trade flows are clearly   inter-releated now.       "Unless we get the budget deficit down, we will not get the   trade deficit down."       He did not elaborate on his views of the linkages between   the two deficits.       Private analysts have said that the financing of large U.S.   budget deficits requires heavy capital inflows from overseas   investors through purchases of U.S. Treasury and, to a lesser   extent, other U.S. securities as well.       "We'll make some progress in reducing the 170 billion dlr   trade deficit in 1987, but there's still a long way to go,"   Yeutter said.       He said the problem must be approached on many fronts and   focus most strongly on U.S. and overseas fiscal and monetary   policies to foster economic growth, U.S. competitiveness and   the establishment of a "level playing field" for trade.       The U.S. trade representative said the Federal Reserve   under Chairman Paul Volcker has done its part to improve the   trade situation by getting interest rates down.       On the fiscal side, Yeutter said "the budget deficit is   still our biggest problem" and there has not been enough   progress toward reducing that deficit.       In the international area, he said that "our major trading   partners could still do more to stimulate domestic growth."   Commenting on Japan, which is running around a 80 billion dlr   trade surplus with the United States, Yeutter said "Japan is   just not doing the job on the import side."       Yeutter declined to comment on statements relating to the   dollar made earlier today by Commerce Dept undersecretary of   Economic Affairs Robert Ortner.       In a Washington address to an Export-Import Bank sponsored   meeting, Ortner said he believed the dollar at current levels   was fairly priced against most European currencies, but that   the yen is 10 or 15 pct undervalued.       "The market will determine the dollar's proper value in the   end," Yeutter said. However, he added that, if the U.S. and   other nations do not take the necessary steps to cut the U.S.   trade deficit, "the dollar will be the equalizer."       Yeutter said there is no quick fix to the trade problem and   any resort to such tactics as protectionist trade legislation   or trade restrictions poses real dangers.       He said "there's relatively little that Congress can do to   legislate a solution to the trade problem."       Protectionist legislation will only provoke retaliation by   U.S. trading partners, Yeutter said.       "There is no doubt in my mind about the willingness of our   trading partners to retaliate against unfair trade   legislation," Yeutter said, adding that policy flexibility is   essential in solving international trade problems.

Growth was highest in Portugal at five pct, while in Greece   output contracted by 0.3 pct, Eurostat said in a statement.       Eurostat noted output growth also fell in the U.S. And   Japan. U.S. Production increased 1.1 pct after 2.0 pct in 1985,   while in Japan output contracted by 0.5 pct after rising 4.5   pct a year earlier.

copper	CHILEAN COPPER WORKERS ELECT LEFT-WING LEADERS   Chilean left-wing leaders were   elected by the copper workers union for the first time since   the left-wing government of Salvador Allende was overthrown in   a 1973 coup.        Nicanor Araya, a member of the Popular Democratic Movement   (MDP), was named president of the Chilean Confederation of   Copperworkers (CTC), which groups 22,000 workers employed in   the state-owned copper mines, union officials said.       Other members of the MDP, which includes the communist   party and a faction of the socialist party, took five of the   principal positions on the union's directorate.       The state-owned copper company of Chile (CODELCO) produces   around 90 pct of the country's copper output of some one mln   tonnes per year. Chile is the world's leading copper exporter   and sales account for just under 50 pct of its export income.       The MDP won six out of the 14 places on the union's   directorate in elections earlier this month, with the christian   democratic party holding five and the remainder being won by   independents.       But the left-wing was left in control of the union after   the christian democrats and independents failed to reach   agreement on a joint candidate for the presidency and withdrew   from negotiations.       Union elections were called following the resignation of   former president Rodolfo Seguel last October.       Seguel, a christian democrat and Chile's best-known union   leader, said he was forced to step down after repeated court   actions brought by CODELCO prevented the union from operating.       The labour leader, who now heads the inter-union national   workers command (CNT), was among 500 workers sacked by CODELCO   following a strike in 1983.       The strike, the only copper industry stoppage staged in the   past 13 years, marked the start of a wave of protests against   the military rule of President Augusto Pinochet.        CODELCO argued that Seguel could not continue as union   leader when no longer employed by the company.

Below 20 degrees API, the company   will adjust its price 0.020 ct per one-tenth of a degree. Crude   grades from 34 degrees API to above 40 degrees are unaffected.
acq	WALL STREET STOCKS/CHRYSLER &lt;C>, AMC &lt;AMO>   The proposed 757 mln dlr deal under   which Chrysler Corp would acquire American Motors Corp was   described by analysts as a reasonable deal for both companies.       Ronald Glantz of Montgomery Securities said AMC common   stock could be fairly valued at "just under five dlrs a share"   given changes brought by tax reform and that Chrysler's offer   to pay four dlrs a share of Chrysler stock to AMC holders other   than Renault as a "a good price for Chrysler.       AMC common shares opened at four dlrs this morning after   the Renault-Chrysler announcement, up 3/8, while Chrysler   shares lost 1/4 to 52-1/4.       Though AMC issued a statement saying that it was studying   the proposed buyout and had no other comment, Glantz said he   regarded the proposal as a "done deal" because "I can't believe   anybody else would make a bid."       "It's a reasonable deal for both sides," the analyst told   Reuters.       "Chrysler gets the jeep franchise and the (new AMC)   Bramalea, Ontario, plant and the (new Renault) Premier   (mid-sized car) and AMC's sales will go up because buyers will   have more confidence that the manufacturer will still be around   to service the products," Glantz said.       Analyst Thomas O'Grady said Chrysler would be getting more   manufacturing capacity, including a brand-new plant in Canada,   for a bargain price and Renault would be getting some return   after its prolonged loss-making investment in AMC.

acq	TAFT &lt;TFB> STOCK RISES ON PROPOSAL   Taft Broadcasting Co stock rose almost   three points today as its vice chairman and an investment group   proposed to sweeten a takeover offer for the company.       However, several arbitragers said they would shy away from   the stock at its current price levels since it is unclear how   high bidding for the company would go and whether the company   would agree to a takeover.       "There are too many uncertainties," said one arbitrager.       Taft stock rose 2-7/8 to 155-3/4.       Dudley Taft, Taft vice chairman, and Narragansett Capital   Inc said they sent a letter to the Taft board, stating they   were committed to pursuing acquisition of the broadcast company   and were prepared to negotiate a transaction in excess of 150   dlrs per share.       The company responded that the proposal would be submitted   to the board of directors, but that no decisions have yet been   made on a sale of the company.       "Someone's betting this company will go for 170 (dlrs per   share)," said one arbitrager.       Arbitragers said the stock is a risky buy at current   levels, unless an offer was accepted in the 170 dlr per share   range. They said to make an arbitrage investment at this level   would be chancy since it will take a long time for any   transaction to be completed because of regulatory approvals   necessary for the broadcast properites.       Taft earlier rejected a 145 dlr per share or 1.35 billion   dlr bid from the investment group. The company said it rejected   the bid as inadequate based on advice of Goldman, Sachs and Co,   its financial adviser. It said it would consider alternatives   such as restructuring.       Arbitragers speculated a bidding war may erupt for Taft,   which has two large shareholders in an investment group led by   Robert Bass and Carl Lindner, chairman of American Financial   Corp. The Bass group holds 25 pct of Taft and Lindner holds   16.2 pct. The Taft family, which founded the company almost 50   years ago, has about 12 pct.       Lindner last week told the Securities and Exchange   Commission he may be interested in making a bid for Taft.       "I could see if things got really crazy that it might go   for 175 (dlrs per share)," said one arbitrager, but he   speculated it probably would not even be taken over for more   than a price in the 160s.       Another speculated that Lindner might bid, but he   speculated the investor would not really be interested in   running the company. Lindner was unavailable for comment.       Dennis McAlpine, an analyst with Oppenheimer and Co, said   he had speculated the company might be considering a leveraged   buyout.       "Ideally, you'd have to break this thing up to satisfy all   the interests involved," he said, adding the two largest   shareholders might be interested in pieces of Taft.       He said the highest takeover price he calculated for the   company has been about 140 dlrs per share, but that the highest   estimates on Wall Street have been about 160. He said the   latter would be based on more optimistic expectations for the   broadcast industry.
crude:gas	DRAWDOWN SEEN IN U.S. DISTILLATE STOCKS   Tonight's American Petroleum Institute   oil inventory report is expected to show another drawdown in   distillate stocks of between two and 7.5 mln barrels for the   week ending March 20, oil analysts and traders said.       They said they expect gasoline inventories to be depleted   by about one to four mln barrels.       Analysts were divided on the crude stocks. Some saw stocks   unchanged to as much as three mln barrels higher. Others said   stocks could be down one to five mln barrels. Crude throughput   volumes are expected to be unchanged to slightly higher or   lower than the week ended March 13, traders said.       The API recorded a 7.4 mln barrel stockdraw for U.S.   distillates in the week ended March 13. Analysts see another    draw reflecting historic seasonal trends.       For the week ended March 13, API reported gasoline stocks   down 2.9 mln barrels.       Those expecting a draw of as much as four mln barrels said   they are looking for fairly high consumption rates as the   spring and summer driving season gets underway this year,   because retail prices are still low compared to recent years.       U.S. crude oil stocks were reported down by 4.4 mln barrels   for the week ended March 13. Analysts are divided over the   outcome for last week because there is uncertainty about   whether throughput levels increased or decreased last week.       Some see crude stock levels unchanged to three mln barrels   higher, while others think inventories could be as much as five   mln barrels below the previous week.       The lower estimates are supported by the belief that crude   runs increased and imports fell.       The API reported crude runs 154,000 b/d higher for the week   ended March 13. Analysts are calling it unchanged to slightly   up or down for the week ended March 20.       Expectations for product stockdraws are already being   reflected in firmer prices, traders said. But if draws are at   the higher end of the estimated range, they added, the effect   will be bullish. Any stockbuild would be a negative factor,   they said.       Crude runs normally increase in March, and any decrease in   runs would be friendly to the market, said Peter Beutel of   Elders Energy Futures Inc.

earn	PUBCO &lt;PUBO> DECLARES DIVIDEND RIGHT   Pubco Corp said its board declared a   dividend distribution of one common stock purchase right on   each outstanding share of Pubco's common stock.       It said each right will entitle shareholders to buy one   share of common stock at an exercise price of three dlrs.       The rights will be exercisable only if a person or group   acquires 20 pct or more of Pubco's common stock or announces a   tender which would result in ownership by a person or group of   20 pct or more of the common stock, the company said.       Pubco said it will be entitled to redeem the rights at 0.1   cts per right at any time before a 20 pct position has been   acquired and afterward in certain circumstances. It said the   exercise price will be substantially reduced in the event of an   acquisition of 25 pct or more of common stock.       If Pubco is acquired in a merger or other transaction, each   right will entitle its holder to purchase, at the right's   then-current exercise price, a number of the acquiring   company's common shares having a market value at that time of   twice the right's exercise price, the company said.       The dividend distribution will be made March 31, 1987,   payable to shareholders of record on that date. The rights will   expire ten years later on March 31, 1987, the company said.       Pubco said the rights are not being distributed in response   to any specific effort to change control of Pubco, and the   board is not aware of any such effort.
acq	HARPER/ROW &lt;HPR> GETS EXPRESSIONS OF INTEREST   Harper and Row Publishers Inc said its   special committee of independent directors has received   expressions of interest from a considerable number of domestic   and foreign firms with respect to restructuring or acquisition   transactions with the company.       Winthrop Knowlton, chairman of special committee said "no   determination has been made by the full board as to any   transaction."       He said the special committee and Kidder Peabody and Co Inc   intend to engage in discussions with interested parties in an   effort to come to a conclusion in the near future.       Formation of the special committee was announced early last   week when Harper and Row said its board had taken no action on   two pending acquisition proposals.       At that time, directors also indefinately postponed a   planned special shareholders vote on a restructuring proposal   which would have created a Class B common with 10 votes a share   and limited transferability.       The acquisition proposals had come from Theodore L. Cross,   owner of about six pct of the company's stock who offered 34   dlrs a share, and Harcourt Brace Jovanovich Inc &lt;HBJ>, which   offered 50 dlrs a share.

money-fx	FRANCE REPAYS SOME OF CURRENCY INTERVENTION DEBT   France today repaid 21.95 billion francs   of short-term currency intervention debt to the European   Monetary Cooperation Fund, EMCF, the Finance Ministry said.       It said the debt was part of a 33.90 billion franc   liability incurred through the activation of EMCF swap   facilities to defend the franc before the January 11 European   Monetary System realignment.       The realignment, following several weeks of speculative   pressure, produced a three pct revaluation of the West German   mark and the Dutch guilder against the French franc and a two   pct revaluation of the Belgian franc.
ship	JAPAN SHIPBUILDERS SEEK CARTEL TO RESTRICT OUTPUT   Japanese shipbuilders have applied to the   state's Fair Trade Commission to form a cartel to restrict   tonnage built to about half of total capacity for the year   starting April 1, officials of the Shipbuilders Association of   Japan said.       Under the plan, 33 yards capable of building ships of more   than 10,000 gross tons will curtail operations to three mln   compensated gross registered tonnes (CGRT) a year against   capacity of about six mln CGRT.       The Transport Ministry estimates new orders at 3.3 mln CGRT   in the year to March 1988 and 3.1 mln the following year.       The industry has curtailed production due to oversupply   nearly every year since 1977/78, under cartel or Transport   Ministry guidelines. The latest guidelines call for a ceiling   of four mln CGRT in the year to March 31.       The cartels, self-imposed and self-regulated, are not   legally binding, but industry finds it in its own interest to   stick to them.       The slowdown in orders has been caused by the strong yen   and a protracted worldwide shipbuilding slump.
ship	ACCORD SAID IN SIGHT IN BRAZIL SEAMEN'S STRIKE   An accord is in sight in Brazil's   20-day-old national seamen's strike, which has seriously   delayed exports, a union official said.       The official, speaking from strike headquarters in Rio de   Janeiro, said up to 30,000 of Brazil's 40,000 seamen were still   on strike.       He said the others had returned to work over the last week,   accepting pay offers of 120 pct from four private companies and   from the Frota Nacional de Petroleiros (Fronape), part of the   state-owned oil company Petrobras.       The association grouping private shipowners, Syndarma, has   also offered 120 pct but talks have so far been deadlocked over   payment for overtime.       The union official said he believed this issue would be   resolved shortly.
copper	PERU'S CENTROMIN SAYS NO COPPER FORCE MAJEURE   Peru's biggest state mining firm,   Centromin SA, said today there was no immediate force majeure   possibility on its copper shipments after guerrillas blew up a   railway line, interrupting train traffic from the Cobriza   copper mine to the Pacific coast.       A Centromin spokesman said the managers of the mine at   Cobriza could always ship the the mineral by road to the coast   for export if the train line continued interrupted. Cobriza   produced the equivalent of around 40,600 fine tonnes of copper   last year.       Maoist guerrillas using dynamite interrupted train traffic   two days ago when they blew up railway tracks and derailed a   train laden with minerals 225 km (135 miles) east of Lima at   Chacapalca, between the coast and Cobriza.       An official at Minero Peru Comercial, Minpeco, Peru's state   minerals marketing firm, confirmed there had been no   declaration of force majeure on the shipments from Cobriza.       Officials at National Train Company, Enafer, headquarters   in Lima, the Peruvian capital, declined to comment on when   train traffic would be restored to Cobriza.       But an Enafer official, reached by telephone in the central   Andean city of Huancayo, near Chacapalca, said traffic could be   restored by Saturday.
interest:money-fx	UK MONEY RATES FALL AS BANK APPROVES BASE RATE CUT   A half point cut in base lending rates   was announced by the big four clearing banks today after the   Bank of England finally endorsed such a move following weeks of   downward pressure, dealers said.       During its routine intervention in the market, the bank   trimmed the rates at which it deals with the discount houses by   half a point and National Westminster led the other clearing   banks in reducing its base rate to 10-1/2 pct from 11 pct.       The timing of the Bank of England move took operators by   surprise after its recent action seemingly designed to dampen   hopes of a base rate cut ahead of the U.K. Budget on March 17.          For some time, fundamentals have   led the market to push for a one point cut in base lending   rates to 10 pct but the central bank has declined to follow   wholesale money market rates down.       Although political considerations -- the government's wish   to see a fall in base rates coincide with the Budget -- had   been suggested by operators last week as reasons for the Bank's   delaying action, worries about the real strength of sterling   and perhaps about the market's reaction to the content of the   Budget may have been behind the central bank's caution, dealers   said.       In the event, sterling continued firm after the rate cut,   leaving the market still looking for another half point fall.       Consequently, rates in the money market eased during the   day, one-month interbank sterling shedding 5/16 point to   10-9/16 7/16 and three-months trading 1/16 point down at   10-5/16 3/16 pct. Sterling cd's were similarly down between   5/16 point in one month and 1/8 point in one year.       Overnight interbank money for tomorrow was indicated at   around 11 pct, almost a point below the levels ruling at the   end of last week. Today, overnight touched a high of some   11-3/4 pct after the Bank took out 228 mln stg of an estimated   300 mln stg shortage.

trade	SOUTH KOREA TO KEEP TRADE SURPLUS 3-5 YEARS   South Korean Trade Minister Rha   Woong Bae said his nation would maintain a trading surplus for   three to five years as a way to cut its foreign debt.       He said in an interview with Reuter that after a few years   it was likely South Korea would drop barriers to foreign goods   and move toward a more balanced trade position.       He said the present trade surplus was vital if his nation   was to reduce its 44.5 billion dlr foreign debt.       Rha said that 1986 was the first year South Korea had a   trade surplus - 4.5 billion dlrs, against a 1985 deficit of    900 mln dlrs.       Rha made his remarks at the end of a two-week trade mission   here during which a team he led agreed to buy U.S. products   valued at 1.8 billion dlrs.       About 800 mln dlrs of the purchases here were in goods of   the type South Korea normally bought from Japan.       Rha leaves today for Ottawa for trade talks with Canadian   officials and businessmen.       Asked if South Korea would retaliate against U.S. goods if   Congress closed U.S. markets to its products, he said "at this   moment, we have no thought of retaliation."       South Korea is a major exporter to the U.S. of textiles and   apparel and electronic goods, such as television sets, video   cassette records and personal computers.       Its purchases from the United States include electronic   testing equipment, grains and cotton.

tin	BULLETIN SAYS TIN PRICE MAY RISE TO 20 RINGGIT   The tin price is likely to rise to   20 ringgit a kilo this year because of the producers' accord on   export quotas and the reluctance of brokers and banks to sell   the metal at lower prices, a Malaysian government bulletin   said.       The Malaysian Tin bulletin said it is in producers'   interest to keep to their quotas to limit total exports to   90,000 tonnes and to gradually deplete the 80,000 tonnes   overhang.       It said consumption by industrialised countries should stay   at 160,000 tonnes and that International Tin Council creditors   and brokers are not likely to dump their stocks excessively   unless there is a large and abrupt price jump.       The continued depreciation of the dollar could also help   push up the price of tin, the bulletin said.       A depreciation of the dollar means the depreciation of the   ringgit which is closely pegged to it, making the price of tin   cheaper in sterling terms, it added.       "Even in the absence of economic rationale in the tin   market, psychological optimism alone is sufficient to secure a   price recovery of up to 20 ringgit per kilo," the bulletin said.
interest	U.S. BILL AUCTION RATES AVERAGE 5.63, 5.59 PCT   The U.S. Treasury said its weekly   auction of three-month bills produced an average rate of 5.63   pct, with a 5.59 pct rate on six-month bills.       These rates compared with averages of 5.47 pct for the   three- and 5.51 pct for the six-month bills sold last week.       The bond-equivalent yield on three-month bills was 5.81   pct. Accepted bids ranges from 5.61 pct to 5.64 pct and 29 pct   of the bids at the high, or stopout rate, were taken. For six   months, the yield was 5.85 pct and the bids ranges from 5.56   pct to 5.60 pct with 30 pct of the bids accepted.       The Treasury said it received 30.9 billion dlrs of bids for   the three-month bills, including 1.0 billion dlrs in   non-competitive bids from the public. It accepted 6.6 billion   dlrs of bids, including 2.2 billion dlrs from the Federal   Reserve and 9.1 mln dlrs from foreign and international   monetary authorities.       Some 25.7 billion dlrs in bids for six-month bills were   received, including 785 mln dlrs in non-competitives. The   Treasury accepted 6.6 billion dlrs, including 1.9 billion dlrs   from the Fed and 942 mln dlrs from foreign and international   authorities.       The average price for the three-month bills was 98.577 and   prices ranged from 98.574 to 98.582.  The average price for the   six-months bills was 97.174, and prices ranged from 97.169 to   97.189.       The average yield on the three-month bills was the highest   since 5.66 pct on Feb 17. The average yield on the six-month   bills was the highest since 5.70 pct on Feb 17.

Managing board chairman Dieter Spethmann told the annual   meeting the group was satisfied with profit developments in the   first half of the 1986/87 financial year to September 30.       The group's other three divisions -- specialty steel,   capital goods and trading -- had made a profit so far in   1986/87, he added.       Spethmann said income from associate companies had also   been good in early 1986/87.       In 1985/86 Thyssen's world group profit fell to 370.1 mln   marks from 472.4 mln in 1984/85, reflecting costs linked to its   steel operations. The company's dividend was an unchanged five   marks.       A Thyssen spokesman told Reuters that planned job cuts at   subsidiary Thyssen Stahl AG would be higher than announced   earlier. Total job losses by 1989 were now expected to total up   to 7,800 against original projections of 5,900. Thyssen Stahl   employs some 40,000 people.

The trade surplus rose to 8.14 billion dlrs in February   from 4.77 billion a year earlier and 5.70 billion in January.       The long-term capital account deficit widened to 11.40   billion dlrs from 8.06 billion a year ago, but it narrowed from   12.32 billion in January, the Ministry said.       Japan's February exports rose to 16.74 billion dlrs from   14.89 billion in February 1986 and from 14.65 billion in   January, the Ministry said. Imports fell to 8.61 billion from   10.12 billion a year earlier and 8.94 billion in January.       The invisible trade deficit fell to 617 mln dlrs in   February from 693 mln a year earlier, but was up from a 527 mln   deficit in January.       Figures do not tally exactly because of rounding.       Transfer payments narrowed to a 140 mln dlr deficit last   month from a 185 mln deficit a year earlier and a 225 mln   deficit in January.       The basic balance of payments deficit in February fell to   4.02 billion dlrs from 4.17 billion in February 1986 and 7.37   billion in January. Short-term capital account payments swung   to a 1.28 billion dlr deficit in February from a 1.60 billion   surplus a year earlier and a 1.44 billion dlr surplus in   January.       Errors and omissions were 2.65 billion dlrs in surplus,   compared with a 1.27 billion surplus a year earlier and a 1.10   billion deficit in January. The overall balance of payments   deficit rose to 2.65 billion dlrs from 1.30 billion a year   earlier but was down from 7.04 billion in January.       The seasonally adjusted trade surplus fell to 9.16 billion   dlrs in February from the record 9.58 billion in January, the   Ministry said.       The seasonally adjusted current account surplus also   dropped to 8.4 billion dlrs in February from the record 8.83   billion set in January.

In March alone, prices rose 0.1 pct after a 0.3 pct rise in   February.       The March index, base 1982, was 109.7 against 109.5 in   February.       The Statistics Office said the March increase reflected   rises in certain sectors such as food, clothing and household   goods and falls in transport, heating and lighting.       Both home produced and imported goods rose by 0.1 pct   during the month. But over the year as a whole, domestically   generated inflation reached 2.5 pct, offset by a 2.8 pct drop   in imports.
